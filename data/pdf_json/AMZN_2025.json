By segment, North America\nrevenue increased 10% YoY from $353B to $387B, International revenue grew 9% YoY from $131B to $143B,\nand AWS revenue increased 19% YoY, from $91B to $108B. For perspective, just 10 years ago, AWS\nrevenue was $4.6B; and in that same year, Amazon\u2019s total revenue was $89B.\n\nAmazon\u2019s operating income in 2024 improved 86% YoY, from $36.9B (an operating margin of 6.4%) to\n$68.6B (an operating margin of 10.8%). Free Cash Flow, adjusted for equipment finance leases improved\nfrom $35.5B in 2023 to $36.2B.",

Free Cash Flow, adjusted for equipment finance leases improved from $35.5B in 2023 to $36.2B.\n\nApart from the financial results, we made our customers\u2019 lives meaningfully better and easier. In our Stores business, we substantially expanded selection, continued lowering prices (independent research firm, Profitero, found Amazon the lowest-priced online U.S. Retailer for the eighth year in a row), and for the second year in a row, we shipped at record speed to our Prime members. AWS launched a slew of new infrastructure and AI services that make it even easier to build remarkable customer experiences, including our latest custom AI silicon (Trainium2), a new set of frontier foundation models in Amazon Nova, and significant expansion of available models and features in our leading Generative AI (\u201cGenAI\u201d) services Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock. Prime Video continued to offer compelling original shows, including new seasons for Fallout, Reacher, The Boys, and The Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power, movies like Road House, The Idea of You, and Red One, live sports like Thursday Night Football and UEFA Champions League in Europe (with the NBA and NASCAR coming in 2025), and new selection, highlighted by Apple TV+ joining Prime Video Channels. We launched a series of new Kindle devices that included a new color version, a larger Scribe option, and our fastest Paperwhites ever (the collection of which drove the highest Kindle unit sales for a single quarter in over a decade). And, we continued to add more selection, price transparency, and same day shipping for Amazon Pharmacy.\n\nThese accomplishments are a subset of what the team launched in 2024, but represent a lot of invention, hard work, and thoughtful execution across Amazon. I\u2019m thankful for my teammates and their delivery this past year (some of which you can see in our 2024 results, others of which won\u2019t be visible for the next few years).\n\nA Why Culture",

At the highest level, we\u2019re aiming to be Earth\u2019s most customer-centric company, making customers\u2019 lives better and easier every day. This is not easy to do in general, let alone year after year. In fact, it\u2019s actually quite hard, especially with the rapid rate of change in technology, customer habits, and new products from large and small companies alike. If we want to have a chance at succeeding in our mission, we have to constantly question everything around us.\n\nWe\u2019ve had this long-held philosophy at Amazon about two-way and one-way door decisions. A two-way door decision is one where if you get the decision wrong, you can walk back through that door, revert to where you were, and there are few (if any) ramifications. You can make these decisions quickly and locally. A one-way door decision is one where it\u2019s quite difficult (if not impossible) to walk back through that door if you get the decision wrong, so these decisions are made more methodically. But, both of these constructs assume the door is unlocked. A lot of invention is about trying to open doors that have historically seemed bolted shut. And, over the past 30 years, we\u2019ve found one of the most important keys to unlock these doors has been a simple question: \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy does this customer experience have to be this way?\u201d \u201cWhy can\u2019t it be better?\u201d \u201cWhat are the constraints\u2014why must we accept them?\u201d \u201cWhy can\u2019t we invent around that?\u201d \u201cWhy will it take so long to get to customers?\u201d Why?\n\nMy Dad has told me that I was the kind of kid who kept asking why, perhaps to an annoying extent. He\u2019s also reminded me how shortly after I joined Amazon in 1997, he tried to persuade me to work somewhere more traditional (and on the east coast closer to family)\u2014only to realize that I\u2019d already found the perfect fit.",

We ask why, and why not, constantly. It helps us deconstruct problems, get to root causes, understand blockers, and unlock doors that might have previously seemed impenetrable. Amazon has an unusually high quotient of this WhyQ (let\u2019s call it \u201cYQ\u201d), and it frames the way we think about everything that we do.\n\nStarting in 1995, we asked why can\u2019t we offer customers every in-print book?\n\nThen, we asked, why limit ourselves to in-print\u2014why can\u2019t we also offer every out-of-print book?\n\nWhy not offer every book, ever written, in any language\u2014all available within 60 seconds on a device that\u2019s light and fits in the palm of your hand (Kindle)?\n\nWhen we offer reviews, why must they all come from professional \u201cexperts?\u201d Customers are great resources and will be brutally honest. Why not include customer reviews even if they sometimes dissuade a purchase?\n\nWhy not offer more than Books? What about Music, Video, Electronics, Tools, Kitchen, Apparel, Home Furnishings?\n\nWhy not practically everything?\n\nWhy should we be the only sellers of these items? Millions of third-party merchants and small sellers offer similar or unique items. Why not let customers choose the selection, price, and delivery speed they prefer from among these millions of sellers?\n\nAfter struggling for a couple years to create awareness for sellers\u2019 selection, we asked ourselves why not show their selection on the same product detail pages as our first-party selection (where all the traffic was)?\n\nWhy not allow our sellers to also store items in our fulfillment network, enable those items to have fast, Prime delivery, and fulfill those items for sellers (a program called Fulfillment by Amazon)?\n\nWhy not experiment with relevant advertisements in our store to expose customers to new sellers and items (versus only what our algorithms might surface based on past purchases)?",

Why should every development team keep reinventing services like compute, storage, database, and analytics? Why should builders spend 80% of their time on the undifferentiated heavy lifting vs. their unique customer experience? Why not build a set of services (AWS) to solve that for internal and external builders?\n\nWhy do I have to buy a physical video to watch a movie? Why do I need cable or linear TV to watch amazing TV shows (Prime Video)?\n\nWhy can\u2019t I get my Prime shipping benefits on other websites than just Amazon (Buy with Prime)?\n\nI can go on. But, you get the idea. Every one of these Whys have led to significant invention, and every one of them have made customers\u2019 lives better and easier. Some of these seem obvious now. But at the time, these were provocative questions that required curiosity, risk-taking, experimentation, and persistence to make these into success stories.\n\n_**Enabling a Why Culture**_\n\nIf you believe having high YQ is critical to inventing for customers, how do you enable it? In my opinion, it\u2019s not solved with one mechanism. It needs to be built deeply into your culture and leadership team, and has to be fiercely protected over time if you\u2019re lucky enough to be successful. Here are a few of the strategies we employ.\n\n**Create leadership principles that set the tone.** We have 16 Leadership Principles that guide our behavior. They\u2019re all integral underpinnings to our YQ, but I\u2019ll touch on three in particular:\n\nAre Right a Lot\n\n\u201cLeaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.\u201d",

They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and\nwork to disconfirm their beliefs.\u201d\n\nWhen we first instituted this leadership principle, some people incorrectly assumed it meant that the best\nleaders were the ones whose ideas were chosen (i.e. they were right, a lot). It led to some people overly digging\nin and fighting for their ideas. There\u2019s nothing wrong with pushing for what you believe. But, in my\nexperience, the best leaders want to hear others\u2019 views. They don\u2019t wilt or bristle when challenged; they\u2019re\nintrigued. Effective leaders change their minds when presented with new compelling information (which\nmakes it ironic how people dismiss politicians as \u201cflip-floppers\u201d when they change their position). Ultimately,\nleaders are responsible for getting to the best answer for customers, regardless of whose original idea is\nchosen.\n\nLearn and be Curious\n\n\u201cLeaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new\npossibilities and act to explore them.\u201d\n\nIn the nearly 28 years I\u2019ve been at Amazon, the biggest difference in the relative growth of companies and\nindividuals has been their aptitude to learn. At a certain point, some leaders seem to lose their thirst to learn.\nIt\u2019s hard to know the reason in each case, but it\u2019s as if some people find it too exhausting, too timeconsuming, or too threatening to not have all the answers. Regardless, the day we stop learning at Amazon\nis the day we risk undermining what we\u2019re capable of building in the future. People with high YQ are always\ncurious how they can get better, become wiser, and incorporate their new knowledge into better customer\nexperiences.\n\nHave Backbone; Disagree and Commit\n\n\u201cLeaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is\nuncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the\nsake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.\u201d",

Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t just empower people to challenge one another, we obligate them to do so if they disagree. Questioning, asking the hard questions, forcing the discussion (versus silently thinking a mistake is being made) is necessary to getting to better answers for customers. \u201cI told you so\u201d has no currency at Amazon. It\u2019s also important to focus on the second part of this leadership principle: _disagree and commit_ . While constructive debate is useful; at some point, teams need to make a decision and take action. From that point on, everybody\u2014even those who advocated for a different solution than the one chosen\u2014must commit to making that decision a success. That means the team goes all in\u2014no pocket-vetoing nor hedging between other options. That\u2019s the only way we can preserve speed and confidence that if an issue is heavily debated, the team will ultimately pull together.\n\n**Create norms that support the Why.** Similar to how our Leadership Principles guide our behavior, we\u2019ve built norms over the years that guide how we work. Here are a few examples:\n\nNarratives. We stopped presenting information to each other inside the company via powerpoint in 2004. Given how high level powerpoints are, we found that powerpoint was easy for the presenter to prepare, but harder for the audience to understand the substantive issues. Instead, we moved to writing narratives with a maximum of six pages in the body. Narratives are harder for the presenter (it\u2019s hard to write a thoughtful six-page document that highlights the key issues in enough detail to be crisp and clear), but much easier for the audience to engage with and ask the right Why questions.\n\nWorking backwards documents. When we build services or features, before we start coding, we write Press Release and Frequently Asked Questions (\u201cFAQ\u201d) documents. The Press Release is intended to ensure that what we\u2019re proposing building is remarkable to customers (so we don\u2019t get to launch and ask \u201cwait, why did we think customers would find this interesting?\u201d). And, the FAQ is designed to force ourselves to ask the",

And, the FAQ is designed to force ourselves to ask the hard questions about which customers will use this capability, what they\u2019ll like most, what they\u2019ll be most disappointed with, why are we drawing the launch line where we are, why is it better than current alternatives, how should we think about pricing, what pricing dimensions we recommend, and why have we made the architectural decisions we have. The Press Release and FAQ are how we work backwards from customers, and how we push ourselves to ask questions customers would if they were in these meetings.\n\nBe together whenever possible. There are many paths that can lead to breakthrough innovation. Occasionally, a lone genius comes up with a brilliant idea, and everyone else simply executes it. While that can work, it\u2019s not how we typically operate. Amazon invention is deeply collaborative. It starts with a seed of an idea, then a group of smart, mission-driven people refine, challenge, and build on it together. And, we\u2019ve found that this process is far more effective in person than remote. Of course, you can invent with everybody remote (and some cultures seem to prefer that). However, in my experience, it doesn\u2019t compare to being in the same room. The energy, the pace, the spontaneous brainstorming, the willingness for people to jump in, the way ideas evolve in real time, and the post-meeting iteration is much better when in the same room\u2014and yields better outcomes for our customers and teams. With what\u2019s happening in AI right now, and the likelihood that every customer experience we\u2019ve ever known will be reinvented, there has never been a more important time, in my opinion, to optimize to invent well.",

You can\u2019t book 60 minutes to invent Amazon Prime, or AWS, or Alexa+, or Fulfillment by Amazon, or Regionalization in our Fulfillment Network, or Project Kuiper. These inventions are borne out of somebody asking why we can\u2019t change what\u2019s possible for customers, and then they take on a life of their own, often meandering down multiple dead ends before getting to a final destination. This might bother some regimented folks. But, when we\u2019re inventing, we accept the process being beautifully imperfect.\n\n**Operate like a startup (in our case, the world\u2019s largest startup).** We strive to operate like the world\u2019s largest startup. What does that mean?\n\nFirst, whatever we\u2019re contemplating building has to be focused on solving a real customer problem or meaningfully improving a customer experience. Companies can get off track prioritizing technology because they\u2019re excited about the technology. Great startups are on a mission to change what\u2019s possible for customers.\n\nSecond, we have a disproportionate need for builders. These are inventors. They\u2019re people constantly dissecting customer experiences, even ones that seem pretty good today, and asking why they can\u2019t be better. They\u2019re divinely discontent (maybe annoyingly so for team members proud of what they\u2019ve previously built), and never feel like the job is done.",

They\u2019re divinely discontent (maybe annoyingly so for team members proud of what they\u2019ve previously built), and never feel like the job is done.\n\nThird, we want owners. One of the strengths of Amazon over the first 30 years is that we\u2019ve hired really smart, motivated, inventive, ambitious people who have been great owners. And, that means that our teammates are constantly asking themselves, \u201cWhat would I do if this was my own money?\u201d \u201cWhat would I do if I started this company and I was the majority owner?\u201d \u201cHey, I know I\u2019ve only been asked to own a part of this project, but I\u2019m not sure if the other parts are being driven well\u2014should I stick my nose into this and make sure or just trust somebody\u2019s got it?\u201d Owners feel accountable. They care deeply about the quality and effectiveness of what they own, and view the company\u2019s mission as their mission (we want missionaries, not mercenaries). That\u2019s part of what our effort to increase the ratio of individual contributors versus managers is about. We want flatter organizations where our owners doing the work feel like they own the two-way door decisions (which are the vast majority), can move rapidly, and are fully accountable for solving the Whys of their customer experiences.\n\nFourth, speed disproportionately matters for every business, in every industry, at all times. It\u2019s a false binary to argue that you can move fast or deliver high standards. If you want to be fast, you can be fast, and still be high quality. We\u2019ve done it for many years (though we can still be faster). Speed is a leadership decision. The leadership team has to believe it\u2019s a priority, reinforce it constantly, organize and remove structural barriers, and build in modular ways that enable pace. But, speed does not happen unless the entire company and culture embrace it. We have this persistent feeling, throughout the company and in every business in which we operate, that there are closing windows all around us. We operate in fiercely competitive market segments, with highly talented, well-funded, ambitious companies at every turn. Customers are always looking",

We spend a lot of time identifying how to unlock these experiences for them as quickly as possible, and know if we don\u2019t, somebody else will.\n\nAnother way to gain speed is to eliminate bureaucracy. There is a difference between process and bureaucracy. When you\u2019re running something at scale, you need mechanisms to deliver the right experience and constant improvement for customers. However, as companies grow and add more managers, unneeded processes get layered on that add little value. Last fall, I asked teammates across the company to send me bureaucracy examples that they were experiencing. I\u2019ve received almost 1,000 of these emails, and read every single one. Builders hate bureaucracy. It slows them down, frustrates them, and keeps them from doing what they came here to do. As leaders, we don\u2019t always see the red tape buried deep in our organizations, but we can sure as heck eliminate it when we do. We\u2019ve already made over 375 changes based on this feedback. We need to move fast, and we are committed to rooting out bureaucracy that ties up time and dispirits our teammates.\n\nFifth, you have to be scrappy. As businesses succeed and get larger, they sometimes forget how things got started. We built Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) with 13 people; Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) with 11 people. Managers can confuse themselves that the way to grow and get ahead is to accumulate large teams. Historically, we\u2019ve had periods where we\u2019ve allowed this thinking to hold sway. But, it\u2019s not the way we fundamentally think about building teams and products, and have adjusted to reflect that again. Our best leaders get the most done with the least number of resources required to do the job. They pride themselves on being lean.",

It won\u2019t all happen in a year or two, but, it won\u2019t take ten either.

        "text": "_**OK, I buy AI is big; but why invest this much this quickly?**_\n\nFundamentally, if your mission is to make customers\u2019 lives better and easier every day, and you believe every\ncustomer experience will be reinvented by AI, you\u2019re going to invest deeply and broadly in AI. That\u2019s why\nthere are more than 1,000 GenAI applications being built across Amazon, aiming to meaningfully change\ncustomer experiences in shopping, coding, personal assistants, streaming video and music, advertising,\nhealthcare, reading, and home devices, to name a few. It\u2019s also why AWS is quickly developing the key\nprimitives (or building blocks) for AI development, such as custom silicon AI chips in Amazon Trainium to\nprovide better price-performance on training and inference, highly flexible model-building and inference\nservices in Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock, our own frontier models in Amazon Nova to provide\nlower cost and latency for customers\u2019 applications, and agent creation and management capabilities.\n\nThere is also substantial capital investment required. In AWS, the faster demand grows, the more datacenters,\nchips, and hardware we need to procure (and AI chips are much more expensive than CPU chips). We\nspend this capital upfront, even though these assets are useful for many years (in the case of datacenters, for\nat least 15-20 years). We only start monetizing this capital investment many months after we spend the\ncapital, and over many years\u2014which leads to attractive long-term FCF and ROIC (as people have seen in\nAWS over the last several years). But in periods, like now, of unusually high demand (our AI revenue is\ngrowing at triple digit YoY percentages and represents a multi-billion-dollar annual revenue run rate), you\u2019re\ndeploying a lot of capital. We continue to believe AI is a once-in-a-lifetime reinvention of everything we\nknow, the demand is unlike anything we\u2019ve seen before, and our customers, shareholders, and business will\nbe well-served by our investing aggressively now.\n\n_**Why do chips and AI have to be this expensive for customers?**_",

        "text": "_**Why do chips and AI have to be this expensive for customers?**_\n\nAI does not have to be as expensive as it is today, and it won\u2019t be in the future. Chips are the biggest culprit.\nMost AI to date has been built on one chip provider. It\u2019s pricey. Trainium should help, as our new Trainium2\nchips offer 30-40% better price-performance than the current GPU-powered compute instances generally\navailable today. While model training still accounts for a large amount of the total AI spend, inference\n(which are the predictions or outputs of the models) will represent the overwhelming majority of future AI\ncost because customers train their models periodically, but produce inferences constantly in large-scale AI\napplications. Inference will become another building block service, along with compute, storage, database,\nand others. We feel strong urgency to make inference less expensive for customers. More price-performant\nchips will help. But, inference will also get meaningfully more efficient in the next couple of years with\nimprovements in model distillation, prompt caching, computing infrastructure, and model architectures.\nReducing the cost per unit in AI will unleash AI being used as expansively as customers desire, and also lead\nto more overall AI spending. It\u2019s like what happened with AWS. Revolutionizing the cost of compute and\nstorage happily led to lower cost per unit, and more invention, better customer experiences, and more absolute\ninfrastructure spend.\n\n_**Why have personal assistants not yet taken off?

        "text": "_**Why have personal assistants not yet taken off? How can Alexa help?**_\n\nA great personal assistant can answer virtually any question and get things done on your behalf. There have been no digital solutions that can do both yet. That is, until Alexa+ arrived. Alexa+ is not only comparably intelligent to the leading chatbots, but can take a plethora of real actions for you. She can play music, play video, move media from one of your devices to another, set alarms and timers, control your smart home, order across hundreds of millions of ecommerce items, make reservations for restaurants or Ubers, order concert tickets, alert you when your favorite artist announces a tour, find a plumber to fix your sink, and memorize whatever you\u2019ve done on Amazon. This is pretty game-changing for consumers, and just the start of what Alexa+ will do. We have over 600 million Alexa devices out there today, and expect Alexa+ to play an even more vital role in the lives of these hundreds of millions of customers in the future.\n\n_**Why can\u2019t we get items to customers even faster? Does it matter?**_\n\nEvery year, people ask whether we\u2019ve reached the law of diminishing returns on speed of delivery. Our data shows this not to be the case. When we promise faster delivery times, customers complete purchases at a meaningfully higher rate and shop with us more frequently. Amazon Prime started with unlimited, free, two-day delivery for a million products; it\u2019s now grown to over 300 million items, with tens of millions available in one day (or better). An increasing number of deliveries happen same day. This speed improvement is primarily due to our regionalization redesign of our fulfillment network, our new placement algorithms, and the introduction of our innovative same-day fulfillment centers. Although we\u2019ve set speed records for two consecutive years, we\u2019re still honing these innovations, and have others planned. And, don\u2019t forget Prime Air, our drones that will get items to customers inside an hour. We are not done improving speed.\n\n_**Why can\u2019t people in small towns enjoy the same fast delivery speeds as people in cities?**_",

We\u2019ve already expanded Same-Day and Overnight Delivery to dozens of smaller cities and towns across the U.S., with more coming. This expansion will provide even faster Amazon delivery speeds for many millions of customers, particularly in less densely populated areas, enabling us to deliver over a billion packages each year to customers living in 13,000 zip codes spanning 1.2 million square miles.\n\n_**Related, why can\u2019t we help the hundreds of millions of people without broadband connectivity?**_\n\nThere are about 400-500 million households around the world, most in small, rural towns that don\u2019t have access to broadband connectivity. They can\u2019t leverage the Internet to learn, shop, do business, access entertainment, and communicate the same way people take for granted in bigger cities. This digital divide is what Project Kuiper, our low Earth orbit satellite network, aims to solve. We\u2019re just launching our first production satellites, and will ultimately have over 3,200 in orbit over the next few years. While capital-intensive to launch, we believe Kuiper will be a meaningful operating income and ROIC business for us.\n\n_**Why does healthcare have to be so stressful?**_\n\nHealthcare, especially in the U.S., is quite frustrating. It\u2019s hard to get fast appointments with primary care physicians, often harder with specialists. There\u2019s a lot of waiting around. Physicians spend only a few minutes with patients. Then, patients have to drive somewhere (often not close) to get their medications. And, when they get to the pharmacy, they\u2019re often surprised by the pricing, what\u2019s covered by their insurance, and what you can easily access that\u2019s not behind a locked shelf. Customers deserve better. It\u2019s why you see such positive customer sentiment and growth for Amazon Pharmacy and Amazon One Medical, and we continue to iterate quickly on selection and transparency for Amazon Pharmacy, and physical clinic capacity for One Medical.\n\nThese are some of the Why questions we\u2019re asking ourselves right now, and I\u2019m excited about the future inventions to come.

That\u2019s so long. I used to tell my friends that would never be me. Now, with almost 28 years and counting at Amazon, I have to answer those same friends with their own Why question.\n\nAfter all these years, why are you still at Amazon?\n\nI\u2019m obviously a Superfan, but there are several compelling parts to working at Amazon. First, I\u2019m not sure that any company prioritizes customers as relentlessly as we do. Lots of companies say they will; few follow through. Second, it\u2019s challenging to find a company where you can make a bigger impact on the world than you can at Amazon. Third, we make significant long-term investments and bets in both inventions and people. This allows our teams to iterate on ideas, and make the right long-term decisions for customers and the company. And, I\u2019ve never encountered a more intelligent, creative, ambitious, hungry, hard-working, and missionary group of teammates than we have at Amazon. In my opinion, this is a remarkable set of qualities to have at a company. And, for builders who want to change the world, and who have fire in their belly, there\u2019s no better place to be than Amazon.\n\nWe operate like the world\u2019s largest startup in large part because of our culture of Why. We don\u2019t always get everything right, and we learn and iterate like crazy.

We realized that the Web was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simply could not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection than was possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy-to-search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offer customers gift certificates, 1-Click [SM] shopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and recommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leader in online bookselling.\n\nBy many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997:\n\n- Sales grew from $15.7 million in 1996 to $147.8 million \u2013 an 838% increase.\n\n- Cumulative customer accounts grew from 180,000 to 1,510,000 \u2013 a 738% increase.\n\n- The percentage of orders from repeat customers grew from over 46% in the fourth quarter of 1996 to over 58% in the same period in 1997.\n\n- In terms of audience reach, per Media Metrix, our Web site went from a rank of 90th to within the top 20.\n\n- We established long-term relationships with many important strategic partners, including America Online, Yahoo!, Excite, Netscape, GeoCities, AltaVista, @Home, and Prodigy.\n\n_Infrastructure_",

This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience, selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time we believe that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities to better serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience. To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but in prioritizing our investments.\n\nWe now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have so much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. The challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several: aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks of product and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity. However, as we\u2019ve long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove to be a very large market, and it\u2019s likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit.

We design\nour stores to enable hundreds of millions of unique products to be sold by us and by third parties across dozens of product\ncategories.

We also manufacture and sell electronic devices, including Kindle, Fire tablet, Fire TV, Echo, Ring, Blink,\nand eero, and we develop and produce media content. We seek to offer our customers low prices, fast and free delivery, easyto-use functionality, and timely customer service. In addition, we offer subscription services such as Amazon Prime, a\nmembership program that includes fast, free shipping on tens of millions of items, access to award-winning movies and series,\nlive sports, and other benefits.\n\nWe fulfill customer orders in a number of ways, including through: North America and International fulfillment networks\nthat we operate; co-sourced and outsourced arrangements in certain countries; digital delivery; and through our physical stores.\nWe operate customer service centers globally, which are supplemented by co-sourced arrangements.

The worldwide\nmarketplace in which we compete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from\nmany different industry sectors around the world. Our current and potential competitors include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and\nomnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we offer and sell to\nconsumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and\nall distribution channels; (3) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, virtual\nassistants, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, or acquiring goods and services, either directly or in\ncollaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website development and hosting,\nomnichannel sales, inventory and supply chain management, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment\nprocessing; (5) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or\noffline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or products, including on-premises or cloud-based\ninfrastructure, tools and services relating to artificial intelligence, and other services; (7) companies that design, manufacture,\nmarket, or sell consumer electronics, communications, and other electronic devices and services; (8) companies that sell grocery\nproducts online and in physical stores; (9) companies that provide advertising services, whether in digital or other formats; and\n(10) providers of virtual or in-person healthcare services. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail\nbusinesses include selection, price, and convenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for\nour seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers\u2019\nability and willingness to change business practices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources,\nlonger histories, more customers, greater brand recognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses.\nThey may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that\nrestrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive\nterms, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The internet facilitates competitive\nentry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser-known businesses to compete against us.\nEach of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the development of new business models and the entry of new and\nwell-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their\ncompetitive positions.",

They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive\npricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.\n\nCompetition continues to intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and\nwell-funded competitors, and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in\nother market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including\nsearch, web and infrastructure computing services, practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, digital\ncontent, satellites, and electronic devices continue to increase our competition. The internet facilitates competitive entry and\ncomparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser known businesses to compete against us. As a result\nof competition, our product and service offerings may not be successful, we may fail to gain or may lose business, and we may\nbe required to increase our spending or lower prices, any of which could materially reduce our sales and profits.\n\n_**Our Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks**_\n\nWe may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or\nservice offerings. These offerings, which can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if\ncustomers of these offerings experience, or are otherwise impacted by, service disruptions, delays, setbacks, or failures or\nquality issues. In addition, profitability or other intended benefits, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations,\nand we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them, which investments are often\nsignificant.

In\ncertain international market segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-tomarket advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations and stores, and\npromote our brand internationally.

For example, in order to meet local ownership, regulatory licensing, and cybersecurity requirements, we provide\ncertain technology services in China through contractual relationships with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide\nservices. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online\nmulti-brand retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to thirdparty sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold an indirect minority interest in an entity that is a\nthird-party seller on the www.amazon.in marketplace.

For example, we expect a disproportionate amount of our retail sales to occur during our fourth quarter. Our failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. When we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could materially reduce profitability. We regularly experience increases in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. In addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service cosourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. Risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory are magnified during periods of high demand.",

In addition, governmental agencies have in the past and could in the future require changes in the way this business is conducted. Under our seller programs, we maintain policies and processes designed to prevent sellers from collecting payments, fraudulently or otherwise, when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers\u2019 descriptions, and to prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen goods, selling goods in an unlawful or unethical manner, violating the proprietary rights of others, or otherwise violating our policies. When these policies and processes are circumvented or fail to operate sufficiently, it can harm our business or damage our reputation and we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers.

Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numerous product categories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, advertising, publishing, and digital content subscriptions.\n\n_Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows._ Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives, including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer experience. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, producing original content, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust.

Our fixed costs\ninclude the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our online\nstores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment network. Variable costs\ngenerally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs,\ngeographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to\nlower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our\nprocesses.

Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting estimates addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \u2014 Note 1 \u2014 Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.\u201d Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.\n\n_Inventories_\n\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2024, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $365 million.",

We\nexpect some or all of them to continue to impact our operations into Q1 2025.\n\n_Net Sales_\n\nNet sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping\nfees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Service sales primarily represent third-party seller fees, which\nincludes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees, AWS sales, advertising services, Amazon Prime\nmembership fees, and certain digital media content subscriptions.

We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we use more expensive shipping methods, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies.

While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in \u201cFulfillment,\u201d AWS costs are primarily classified as \u201cTechnology and infrastructure.\u201d Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent to which third-party sellers utilize Fulfillment by Amazon services, timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transaction costs as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions.",

Our technology and infrastructure investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and infrastructure to increase over time as we continue to add employees and infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and infrastructure costs in 2024, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to an increase in spending on infrastructure, partially offset by decreased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings and a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense from our change in the estimated useful life of our servers. Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced technology and infrastructure costs by $244 million in 2024. We currently expense the majority of the costs associated with the development of our satellite network for global broadband service (including production, launch, and payroll costs, and launch services deposits upon launch). We will capitalize certain of these costs once the service achieves commercial viability, including sales to customers.\n\n_Sales and Marketing_\n\nSales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, third-party customer referrals, social and online advertising, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs.\n\nThe decrease in sales and marketing costs in 2024, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to decreased payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, partially offset by increased advertising expenses.

We serve consumers\nthrough our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We offer programs that enable sellers to\ngrow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders using our services, and programs that allow authors,\nindependent publishers, musicians, filmmakers, Twitch streamers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell\ncontent. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology\nservices, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services. We also manufacture and\nsell electronic devices. In addition, we provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through\nprograms such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising.\n\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. See \u201cNote 10 \u2014\nSegment Information.\u201d\n\n_**Common Stock Split**_\n\nOn May 27, 2022, we effected a 20-for-1 stock split of our common stock and proportionately increased the number of\nauthorized shares of common stock. All share, restricted stock unit (\u201cRSU\u201d), and per share or per RSU information throughout\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. The shares of common stock retain a\npar value of $0.01 per share.

Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated.\n\n_**Use of Estimates**_\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives\nof equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based compensation\nforfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, impairment of property and equipment and\noperating leases, valuation and impairment of investments, self-insurance liabilities, and viewing patterns of capitalized video\ncontent. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. We review the useful lives of equipment on an ongoing\nbasis.\n\nIn Q4 2024, we completed a useful life study for certain types of heavy equipment and are increasing the useful life from\nten years to thirteen years for such equipment effective January 1, 2025. Based on heavy equipment included in \u201cProperty and\nequipment, net\u201d as of December 31, 2024, we estimate an increase in 2025 operating income of approximately $0.9 billion,\nwhich will be recorded primarily in \u201cFulfillment\u201d and impact our North America and International segments.",

For those assets included in \u201cProperty and equipment, net\u201d as of December 31, 2024, whose useful life will change from six years to five years, we anticipate a decrease in 2025 operating income of approximately $0.7 billion. We expect to continue to acquire more of these server and networking assets in 2025. In 2024, we also determined, primarily in the fourth quarter, to retire early certain of our servers and networking equipment. We recorded approximately $920 million of accelerated depreciation and related charges for the quarter ended December 31, 2024 related to these decisions. The accelerated depreciation will continue into 2025 and decrease operating income by approximately $0.6 billion in 2025. These two changes above are due to an increased pace of technology development, particularly in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n\nWe had previously increased the useful life of our servers from five years to six years effective January 1, 2024.

Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.\n\n_Third-party seller services_    - We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders using our services. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. The commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services are rendered, which generally occurs upon delivery of the related products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.\n\n_Advertising services_    - We provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising. Revenue is recognized as ads are delivered based on the number of clicks or impressions.\n\n_Subscription services_    - Our subscription sales include fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to content including digital video, audiobooks, digital music, e-books, and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime memberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that represent a single stand-ready obligation. Subscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized over the subscription period.\n\n_AWS_   - Our AWS arrangements include global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is allocated to services using stand-alone selling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services, based on the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. Certain services, including compute and database, are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognized ratably. Sales commissions we pay in connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term.\n\n_Other_   - Other revenue includes sales related to various other offerings, such as healthcare services, certain licensing and distribution of video content, and shipping services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Revenue is recognized when content is licensed or distributed and as or when services are performed.\n\n_**Return Allowances**_",

The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. Under this method, approximately 50% of the grant date fair value is recognized as expense in the first year of grant for the majority of our stock-based compensation awards. The accelerated method also adds a higher level of sensitivity and complexity in estimating forfeitures. If an award is forfeited early in its life, the adjustment to compensation expense is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straight-line method. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including historical forfeiture experience. Additionally, we have stock-based compensation awards that are expected to settle in cash. These liability-classified awards are remeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period until settlement or expiration.\n\n_**Other Operating Expense (Income), Net**_\n\nOther operating expense (income), net, consists primarily of the amortization of intangible assets and asset impairments.\n\n44\n\n_**Other Income (Expense), Net**_",

Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.\n\nWe utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (income tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

When the license fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us, we recognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments are made and we amortize the asset to \u201cCost of sales\u201d on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line basis. If the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred. We also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to \u201cCost of sales\u201d predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the estimated viewing patterns associated with the content. The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 3.1 years. We review usage and viewing patterns impacting the amortization of capitalized video content on an ongoing basis and reflect any changes prospectively.\n\nOur produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each major geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships. These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value. The total capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2023 and 2024 were $17.4 billion and $19.6 billion. Total video and music expense was $18.9 billion and $20.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2024. Total video and music expense includes licensing and production costs associated with content offered within Amazon Prime memberships, and costs associated with digital subscriptions and sold or rented content.\n\n_**Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities**_\n\nWe generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term marketable debt securities and AAA-rated money market funds.

The complaint alleged, among other things, that \u201cAlexa Voice Software and Alexa enabled devices\u201d infringe U.S. Patent No. 7,177,798, entitled \u201cNatural Language Interface Using Constrained Intermediate Dictionary of Results.\u201d The complaint sought an injunction, an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, an ongoing royalty, interest, attorneys\u2019 fees, and costs. In March 2023, the plaintiffs alleged in their damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be subject to $140 million to $267 million in damages. In March 2024, the district court granted summary judgment ruling that the patent is invalid and dismissed the case. In April 2024, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.",

It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax controversies in one or more jurisdictions.
