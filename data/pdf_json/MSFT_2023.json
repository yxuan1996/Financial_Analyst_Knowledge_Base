        "text": "Dear shareholders, colleagues, customers, and partners,\n\nWe are living through a time of historic challenge and opportunity. As I write this, the world faces ongoing economic,\nsocial, and geopolitical volatility. At the same time, we have entered a new age of AI that will fundamentally\ntransform productivity for every individual, organization, and industry on earth, and help us address some of our\nmost pressing challenges.\n\nThis next generation of AI will reshape every software category and every business, including our own. Forty-eight\nyears after its founding, Microsoft remains a consequential company because time and time again\u2014from PC/Server,\nto Web/Internet, to Cloud/Mobile\u2014we have adapted to technological paradigm shifts. Today, we are doing so once\nagain, as we lead this new era.\n\nAmid this transformation, **our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to**\n**achieve more** remains constant. As a company, we believe we can be the democratizing force for this new\ngeneration of technology and the opportunity it will help unlock for every country, community, and individual, while\nmitigating its risks.\n\nHere are just a few examples of how we are already doing this:\n\n- Leading electronic health records vendor Epic is addressing some of the biggest challenges facing the\nhealthcare industry today\u2014including physician burnout\u2014by deploying a wide range of copilot solutions\nbuilt on Azure OpenAI Service and Dragon Ambient eXperience Copilot.\n\n- Mercado Libre is reducing the time its developers spend writing code by more than 50 percent with GitHub\nCopilot, as the company works to democratize e-commerce across Latin America.\n\n- Mercedes-Benz is making its in-car voice assistant more intuitive for hundreds of thousands of drivers using\nChatGPT via the Azure OpenAI Service.\n\n- Lumen Technologies is helping its employees be more productive, enabling them to focus on higher valueadded activities, by deploying Microsoft 365 Copilot.\n\n- Nonprofit The Contingent is matching foster families with children in need using Dynamics 365, Power BI,\nand Azure, with an eye on using AI to amplify its work across the US.\n\n- And, Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of Education has built an online platform to help elementary and high school\nstudents learn English using Azure AI.",

Second, because we\nknow that maximum enterprise value gets created during platform shifts like this one, we will invest to accelerate our\nlead in AI by infusing this technology across every layer of the tech stack. And, finally, we will continue to drive\noperating leverage, aligning our cost structure with our revenue growth.\n\nAs we make progress on these priorities, we delivered strong results in fiscal year 2023, including a record\n$211 billion in revenue and over $88 billion in operating income.\n\n**A NEW ERA OF AI**\n\nThere are two breakthroughs coming together to define this new era of AI. The first is the most universal interface:\nnatural language. The long arc of computing has, in many ways, been shaped by the pursuit of increasingly intuitive\nhuman-computer interfaces\u2014keyboards, mice, touch screens. We believe we have now arrived at the next big step\nforward\u2014natural language\u2014and will quickly go beyond, to see, hear, interpret, and make sense of our intent and the\nworld around us.\n\nThe second is the emergence of a powerful new reasoning engine. For years, we\u2019ve digitized daily life, places, and\nthings and organized them into databases. But in a world rich with data, what has been most scarce is our ability to\nreason over it. This generation of AI helps us interact with data in powerful new ways\u2014from completing or\nsummarizing text, to detecting anomalies and recognizing images\u2014to help us identify patterns and surface insights\nfaster than ever.",

And, in fact, just last month we announced\nour vision for Copilot, an everyday AI companion. We are building Copilot into all our most used products and\nexperiences and allowing people to summon its power as a standalone app as well. Just like you boot up an OS to\naccess applications or use a browser to visit websites today, our belief is that you will invoke a Copilot to do all those\nactivities and more: to shop, to code, to analyze, to learn, to create.\n\nAs a company, any time we approach a transition like this, we do so responsibly. We believe AI should be as\nempowering across communities as it is powerful, and we\u2019re committed to ensuring it is responsibly built and\ndesigned, with safety in mind from the outset.\n\n**OUR OPPORTUNITY**\n\nEvery customer solution area and every layer of our tech stack will be reimagined for the AI era. And that\u2019s exactly\nwhat we\u2019ve already begun to do:\n\n_Infrastructure_\n\nFour years ago, we first invested in our AI supercomputer, with a goal of building the best cloud for training and\ninference. Today, it\u2019s being used by our partner OpenAI to power its best-in-class foundation models and services,\nincluding one of the fastest-growing consumer apps ever\u2014ChatGPT. NVIDIA, as well as leading AI startups like\nAdept and Inflection, is also using our infrastructure to build its own breakthrough models.\n\nMore broadly, organizations continue to choose our ubiquitous computing fabric\u2014from cloud to edge\u2014to run their\nmission-critical applications. We continued to see more cloud migrations to Azure this past fiscal year, as it remains\nearly when it comes to the long-term cloud opportunity. And we also continue to lead in hybrid computing with\nAzure Arc, which now has 18,000 customers.\n\n_Data and AI_",

And we also continue to lead in hybrid computing with Azure Arc, which now has 18,000 customers.\n\n_Data and AI_\n\nEvery AI app starts with data, and having a comprehensive data and analytics platform is more important than ever. Our Intelligent Data Platform brings together operational databases, analytics, and governance so organizations can spend more time creating value and less time integrating their data estate. We also introduced Microsoft Fabric this year, which unifies compute, storage, and governance with a disruptive business model.\n\nWith Azure AI, we are making foundation models available as platforms to our customers. We offer the best selection of industry-leading frontier and open models. In January, we made the Azure OpenAI Service broadly available, bringing together advanced models, including ChatGPT and GPT-4, with the enterprise capabilities of Azure. More than 11,000 organizations across industries are already using it for advanced scenarios like content and code generation. Meta chose us this summer as its preferred cloud to commercialize its Llama family of models. And, with Azure AI Studio, we provide a full lifecycle toolchain customers can use to ground these models on their own data, create prompt workflows, and help ensure they are deployed and used safely.\n\n_Digital and app innovation_\n\nGitHub Copilot is fundamentally transforming developer productivity, helping developers complete coding tasks 55 percent faster. More than 27,000 organizations have chosen GitHub Copilot for Business, and to date more than\n\n2\n\n1 million people have used GitHub Copilot to code faster. We also announced our vision for the future of software development with GitHub Copilot X, which will bring the power of AI throughout the entire software development lifecycle. All up, GitHub surpassed $1 billion in annual recurring revenue for the first time this fiscal year.\n\nWe\u2019re also applying AI across our low-code/no-code toolchain to help domain experts across an organization automate workflows, create apps and webpages, build virtual agents, or analyze data, using just natural language with copilots in Power Platform. More than 63,000 organizations have used AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform to date.\n\n_Business applications_",

More than 63,000 organizations have used AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform to date.\n\n_Business applications_\n\nWe are bringing the next generation of AI to employees across every job function and every line of business with Dynamics 365 Copilot, which works across CRM and ERP systems to reduce burdensome tasks like manual data entry, content generation, and notetaking. In fact, our own support agents are using Copilot in Dynamics 365 Customer Service to resolve more cases faster and without having to call on peers to help. With our Supply Chain Platform, we\u2019re helping customers apply AI to predict and mitigate disruptions. And, with our new Microsoft Sales Copilot, sellers can infuse their customer interactions with data from CRM systems\u2014including _both_ Salesforce and Dynamics\u2014to close more deals.\n\nAll up, Dynamics surpassed $5 billion in revenue over the past fiscal year, with our customer experience, service, and finance and supply chain businesses each surpassing $1 billion in annual sales.\n\n_Industry_\n\nAcross industries, we are rapidly becoming the partner of choice for any organization looking to generate real value from AI. In healthcare, for example, we introduced the world\u2019s first fully automated clinical documentation application, DAX Copilot. The application helps physicians reduce documentation time by half, freeing them to spend more time face to face with patients. And Epic will integrate it directly into its electronic health records system.\n\nAnd, in retail, we introduced new tools to help companies manage their day-to-day operations and digitize their physical stores.\n\n_Modern work_\n\nWe are rapidly evolving Microsoft 365 into an AI-first platform that enables every individual to amplify their creativity and productivity, with both our established applications like Office and Teams, as well as new apps like Designer, Stream, and Loop.

Microsoft 365 is designed for today\u2019s digitally connected, distributed workforce.\n\nThis year, we also introduced a new pillar of customer value with Microsoft 365 Copilot, which combines nextgeneration AI with business data in the Microsoft Graph and Microsoft 365 applications to help people be more productive and unleash their creativity at work. Just last month, I was excited to announce that we will make Microsoft 365 Copilot generally available to our commercial customers later this year.\n\nWe continue to build momentum in Microsoft Teams across collaboration, chat, meetings, and calls. We introduced a new version of Teams that delivers up to two times faster performance, while using 50 percent less memory. We also introduced Teams Premium to meet enterprise demand for AI-powered features like intelligent meeting recaps. All up, Teams usage surpassed 300 million monthly active users this year.\n\nWith Microsoft Viva, we have created a new category for employee experience. Copilot in Viva offers leaders a new way to build high-performance teams by prioritizing both productivity and employee engagement. This year, Viva surpassed 35 million monthly active users.\n\n3\n\n_Security_\n\nAs the rate and pace of cyberthreats continue to accelerate, security is a top priority for every organization. Our comprehensive, AI-powered solutions give defenders the advantage. With Security Copilot, we\u2019re combining large language models with a domain-specific model informed by our threat intelligence and 65 trillion daily security signals, to transform every aspect of security operations center productivity.\n\nAll up, more than 1 million organizations now count on our comprehensive, AI-powered solutions to protect their digital estates, and our security business surpassed $20 billion in annual revenue, as we help protect customers across clouds and endpoint platforms.\n\n_Search, advertising, and news_",

We think of these tools as an AI copilot for the web.\n\nWe are also bringing these breakthrough capabilities to businesses, with Bing Chat Enterprise, which offers commercial data protection, providing an easy on-ramp for any organization looking to get the benefit of nextgeneration AI today.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s early in our journey, Bing users engaged in more than 1 billion chats and created more than 750 million images over the past year as they apply these new tools to get things done. And Edge has taken share for nine consecutive quarters.\n\nMore broadly, we continue to expand our opportunity in advertising. This year, Netflix chose us as its exclusive technology and sales partner for its first ad-supported subscription offering, a validation of the differentiated value we provide to any publisher looking for a flexible partner to build and innovate with them.\n\n_LinkedIn_\n\nThe excitement around AI is creating new opportunities across every function\u2014from marketing, sales, service, and finance, to software development and security. And LinkedIn is increasingly where people are going to learn, discuss, and uplevel their skills. We are using AI to help our members and customers connect to opportunities and tap into the experiences of experts on the platform. In fact, our AI-powered articles are already the fastest-growing traffic driver to the network.\n\nAll up, LinkedIn\u2019s revenue surpassed $15 billion for the first time this fiscal year, a testament to how mission critical the platform has become to help more than 950 million members connect, learn, sell, and get hired.\n\n_Gaming_",

With Xbox Game Pass, we are redefining how games are distributed, played, and\nviewed. Content is the flywheel behind the service\u2019s growth, and our pipeline has never been stronger. It was\nespecially energizing to release Starfield this fall to broad acclaim, with more than 10 million players in the first\nmonth post-launch alone.\n\nEarlier this month, we were thrilled to close our acquisition of Activision Blizzard, and we look forward to sharing\nmore in the coming months about how, together, we will bring the joy of gaming to more people around the world.\n\n4\n\n_Devices and creativity_\n\nFinally, we\u2019re turning Windows into a powerful new AI canvas with Copilot, which rolled out as part of a Windows 11\nupdate last month. It uniquely incorporates the context and intelligence of the web, your work data, and what you\nare doing in the moment on your PC to provide better assistance, while keeping your privacy and security at the\nforefront. Overall, the number of devices running Windows 11 more than doubled in the past year.

To do this, we focus on four enduring commitments that are central to our mission and that take on even\ngreater importance in this new era. For us, these commitments are more than just words. They\u2019re a guide to help us\nmake decisions across everything we do\u2014as we design and develop products, shape business processes and\npolicies, help our customers thrive, build partnerships, and more\u2014always asking ourselves critical questions to\nensure our actions are aligned with them.\n\n_How can we expand opportunity?_",

        "text": "_How can we expand opportunity?_\n\nFirst, we believe access to economic growth and opportunity should reach every person, organization, community,\nand country. And although AI can serve as a catalyst for opportunity and growth, we must first ensure everyone has\naccess to the technologies, data, and skills they need to benefit.\n\nTo achieve this, we are focused on getting technology into the hands of nonprofits, social entrepreneurs, and other\ncivil society organizations to help them digitally transform, so they can help address some of society\u2019s biggest\nchallenges. This year, we provided nonprofits with over $3.8 billion in discounted and donated technology. Nearly\n325,000 nonprofits used our cloud. And to help them tap the potential of AI, we\u2019re building new AI capabilities for\nfundraising, marketing, and program delivery.\n\nAI will displace some jobs, but it will also create new ones. That\u2019s why we aim to train and certify 10 million people by\n2025 with the skills for jobs and livelihoods in an increasingly digital economy. Since July 2020, we\u2019ve helped\n8.5 million people, including 2.7 million this year. We\u2019ve also focused on skilling women and underrepresented\ncommunities in cybersecurity, working across 28 countries and with nearly 400 US community colleges to scale our\nefforts.\n\nFinally, to help people learn more about AI, we launched the first online Professional Certificate on Generative AI in\npartnership with LinkedIn Learning, created AI tools for educators, and held our first AI Community Learning event in\nthe US. These events will be replicated around the world and localized in 10 languages over the next year. We also\npartnered to launch a Generative AI Skills Grant Challenge to explore how nonprofit, social enterprise, and research\nor academic institutions can empower the workforce to use this new generation of AI.\n\n_How can we earn trust?_\n\nTo create positive impact with technology, people need to be able to trust the technologies they use and the\ncompanies behind them. For us, earning trust spans the responsible use of AI, protecting privacy, and advancing\ndigital safety and cybersecurity.\n\nOur commitment to responsible AI is not new.

We also enable our customers and partners to\n\ndevelop and deploy AI safely, including through our AI customer commitments and services like Azure AI Studio,\nwith its content safety tooling and access to our Responsible AI dashboard.\n\nBuilding AI responsibly requires that we work with other industry leaders, civil society, and governments to advocate\nfor AI regulations and governance globally. This year, we released our Governing AI Blueprint, which outlines\nconcrete legal and policy recommendations for AI guardrails. We are signatories to the eight voluntary commitments\ndeveloped with the US White House, and proud of the six additional commitments we\u2019ve made to further strengthen\nand operationalize the principles of safety, security, and trust.\n\nThe era of AI heightens the importance of cybersecurity, and we deepened our work across the private and public\nsectors to improve cyber-resilience. We\u2019ve continued to support Ukraine in defending critical infrastructure,\ndetecting and disrupting cyberattacks and cyberinfluence operations, and providing intelligence related to these\nattacks. Our Microsoft Threat Analysis Center team produced more than 500 intelligence reports to help keep\ncustomers and the public informed. And we published our third annual Microsoft Digital Defense Report, sharing our\nlearnings and security recommendations.\n\nWe also remain committed to creating safe experiences online and protecting customers from illegal and harmful\ncontent and conduct, while respecting human rights.

For us, this means upholding responsible business practices, expanding\nconnectivity and accessibility, advancing fair and inclusive societies, and empowering communities.\n\nIn 2023, we worked diligently to anticipate harmful uses of our technology and put guardrails on the use of\ntechnologies that are consequential to people\u2019s lives or legal status, create risk of harm, or threaten human rights.\nWe will continue to assess the impact of our technologies, engage our stakeholders, and model and adopt\nresponsible practices and respect for human rights\u2014including across our global supply chain.\n\nToday, our lives are more connected than ever. Access to education, employment, healthcare, and other critical\nservices is increasingly dependent on technology. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve expanded our commitment to bring access to\naffordable high-speed internet to a quarter of a billion people around the world, including 100 million people in\nAfrica, by the end of 2025.

That means taking responsibility for our operational footprint and accelerating progress through technology.\n\nWe continue to see extreme weather impacting communities globally. To meet the urgent need, this must be a decade of innovation and decisive action\u2014for Microsoft, our customers, and the world.\n\nIn our latest Environmental Sustainability Report, we shared our progress toward our 2030 sustainability targets across carbon, water, waste, and ecosystems. In 2022, our overall carbon emissions declined by 0.5 percent while our business grew. Addressing scope 3 emissions, which account for the vast majority of our emissions, is arguably our ultimate challenge\u2014one we\u2019ll continue to tackle through our supply chain, policy advances, and industry-wide knowledge-sharing.",

And in our pursuit to be zero waste, we achieved a reuse and recycle rate of 82 percent for all our cloud hardware and diverted over 12,000 metric tons of solid operational waste from landfills and incinerators.\n\nWe also continue to take responsibility for the impacts of our direct operations on Earth\u2019s ecosystems. We\u2019ve contracted to protect 17,268 acres of land, over 50 percent more than the land we use to operate. Of that, 12,270 acres\u2014the equivalent of approximately 7,000 soccer fields\u2014were designated as permanently protected.\n\nTechnology is a powerful lever to help us avoid the most severe impacts of climate change. That\u2019s why we\u2019re accelerating our investment in more efficient datacenters, clean energy, enhancements to the Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability and Planetary Computer, and green software practices. To date, through our Climate Innovation Fund, we\u2019ve allocated more than $700 million to a global portfolio of 50+ investments spanning sustainable solutions in energy, industrial, and natural systems.\n\nFinally, we believe AI can be a powerful accelerant in addressing the climate crisis. We expanded our AI for Good Lab in Egypt and Kenya to improve climate resilience for the continent. And, together with our partners, we launched Global Renewables Watch, a first-of-its-kind living atlas that aims to map and measure utility-scale solar and wind installations, allowing users to evaluate progress toward a clean energy transition.",

As we pursue our four commitments, we focus on transparency\u2014providing clear reporting on how we run our business and how we work with customers and partners. Our annual Impact Summary shares more about our progress and learnings this year, and our Reports Hub provides detailed reports on our environmental data, political activities, workforce demographics, human rights work, and more.\n\n**OUR CULTURE**\n\nThere\u2019s never been a more important time to live our culture. The way we work and the speed at which we work are changing.\n\nIn an economy where yesterday\u2019s exceptional is today\u2019s expected, all of us at Microsoft will need to embrace a growth mindset and, more importantly, confront our fixed mindsets as our culture evolves. It will take everyday courage to reformulate what innovation, business models, and sales motions look like in this new era. As a\n\n7\n\nhigh-performance organization, we aspire to help our employees maximize their economic opportunity, while simultaneously helping them learn and grow professionally and connect their own passion and purpose with their everyday work and the company\u2019s mission.\n\nTo be successful, we need to be grounded in what our customers and the world need. We need to innovate and collaborate as One Microsoft. And we need to actively seek diversity and embrace inclusion to best serve our customers and create a culture where everyone can do their best work. To empower the world, we need to represent the world. To that end, we remain focused on increasing representation and strengthening our culture of inclusion. Even as we navigated challenges this year, our company continued to be the most globally diverse it\u2019s ever been.\n\nGiving also remains core to our culture. This year, more than 105,000 employees gave $242 million (including company match) to over 35,000 nonprofits in 116 countries. And our employees volunteered over 930,000 hours to causes they care about.",

We have an incredible opportunity to use this new era of AI to deliver meaningful benefits for every person and every organization on the planet.\n\nOn New Year\u2019s Day, I saw a tweet from Andrej Karpathy, Tesla\u2019s former director of AI who now works at OpenAI, about how GitHub Copilot was writing about 80 percent of his code, with 80 percent accuracy. Two days later, I saw a stunning example of work we\u2019ve done with the government of India\u2019s Ministry of Electronics and IT, which is applying an AI model so farmers in rural areas can interact with government resources in their native languages.\n\nThink about that: A foundation model that was developed on the West Coast of the United States is already transforming the lives of both elite developers _and_ rural farmers on the other side of the globe. We\u2019ve not seen this speed of diffusion and breadth of impact in the tech industry before.\n\nAs a company, this is our moment to show up and responsibly build solutions that drive economic growth and benefit every community, country, industry, and person. If we do it well, the world will do well, and Microsoft will do well too. I\u2019ve never been more confident that we will deliver on this promise together in the days, months, and years to come.\n\nSatya Nadella\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer\nOctober 16, 2023\n\n8\n\n**ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES, DIVIDENDS, AND STOCK PERFORMANCE**\n\nMARKET AND STOCKHOLDERS\n\nOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol MSFT.

In 2022, we reported that all racial and ethnic minority employees in the U.S. combined earn $1.008 for every $1.000 earned by their white counterparts, that women in the U.S. earn $1.007 for every $1.000 earned by their counterparts who are men, and that women outside the U.S. earn $1.002 for every $1.000 earned by their counterparts outside the U.S. who are men.

For employees who are eligible for rewards, the analysis showed that total pay for women is 89.6% of total pay for men in the U.S. and 86.2% outside of the U.S., and total pay for racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S. is 89.9% of total pay for white employees.

Our competitors\nare developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and\nbusinesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, influencing how users access services in\nthe cloud and, in some cases, the user\u2019s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. Aggregate demand for\nour software, services, and devices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain\ndynamic. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment.\n\nThe investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating\ncosts and may decrease our operating margins. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our\ndatacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given\nthe growing demand for AI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land,\npredictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (\u201cGPUs\u201d) and other\ncomponents. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our\nproducts, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet\nour requirements. However, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified\nsuppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet\nconsumer demand.\n\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university\nand industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working\nenvironment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one\u2019s career across many different\nproducts and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits.\n\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue\nand expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates\nmay significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies\nreduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2023.",

Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2023.\n\nOn January 18, 2023, we announced decisions we made to align our cost structure with our revenue and customer demand, prioritize our investments in strategic areas, and consolidate office space. As a result, we recorded a $1.2 billion charge in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 (\u201cQ2 charge\u201d), which included employee severance expenses of $800 million, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. First, we reduced our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 related to the Q2 charge, which represents less than 5% of our total employee base. While we eliminated roles in some areas, we will continue to hire in key strategic areas. Second, we are allocating both our capital and talent to areas of secular growth and long-term competitiveness, while divesting in other areas. Third, we are consolidating our leases to create higher density across our workspaces, which impacted our financial results through the remainder of fiscal year 2023, and we may make similar decisions in future periods as we continue to evaluate our real estate needs.\n\nRefer to Risk Factors in our fiscal year 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\n\n**Seasonality**\n\nOur revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period.\n\n**Change in Accounting Estimate**\n\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment.

Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.\n\n**Cash Flows**\n\nCash from operations decreased $1.5 billion to $87.6 billion for fiscal year 2023, mainly due to an increase in cash paid to employees and suppliers and cash used to pay income taxes, offset in part by an increase in cash received from customers.

We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings and our investments in AI infrastructure.

We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and inventories.\n\n42\n\n**Revenue Recognition**\n\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.",

We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.\n\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\n\nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\n\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize.

Changes to\nour estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.\n\n**Impairment of Investment Securities**\n\nWe review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair\nvalue, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the\nextent to which the fair value is less than cost. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this\njudgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in\nevaluating potential impairment of our investments. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to\nthe financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely\nthan not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is\nrecorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is\nestablished. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.\n\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment\nindicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform\na qualitative assessment on a periodic basis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to\ndetermine the amount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment\ncharge is recorded in other income (expense), net.\n\n**Goodwill**\n\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business\ncombination.

We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative\n\n43\n\nfair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.\n\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.\n\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.\n\n**Research and Development Costs**\n\nCosts incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.\n\n**Legal and Other Contingencies**",

An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\n\n**Income Taxes**\n\nThe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity\u2019s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns.

Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\n**Estimates and Assumptions**\n\nPreparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price (\u201cSSP\u201d) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management\u2019s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.\n\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for fiscal year 2023 was an increase in operating income of $3.7 billion and net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.40 per both basic and diluted share.\n\n**Foreign Currencies**",

Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is\nmade available to the customer.

When a cloud-based service includes\nboth on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software\nlicense is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud\nservice and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of\nintegration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are\naccounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the\nperiod in which the cloud services are provided.\n\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to\nestimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates\nprovided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and\nservices separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of\nthe various products and services.\n\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we\ndetermine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically\nhave more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services\nby customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and\ngeographic region in determining the SSP.\n\nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of\ndelivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.",

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $904 million, $1.5 billion, and $1.5 billion in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\n\n**Stock-Based Compensation**\n\nCompensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) and performance stock units (\u201cPSUs\u201d), is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service or performance period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. We measure the fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using the straight-line method and for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method.\n\nCompensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (\u201cESPP\u201d) is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.\n\n**Employee Severance**\n\nOn January 18, 2023, we announced a decision to reduce our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $800 million of employee severance expenses related to these job eliminations as part of an ongoing employee benefit plan. These employee severance expenses were incurred as part of a corporate program, and were included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated income statements and allocated to our segments based on relative gross margin. Refer to Note 19 \u2013 Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information.\n\n57\n\n**Income Taxes**",

Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified as long-term in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n**Financial Instruments**\n\n_**Investments**_\n\nWe consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.\n\nDebt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive income. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. To determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.",

Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net.\n\n_**Derivatives**_\n\nDerivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.\n\nFor derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.\n\nFor derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding hedged item. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.\n\nFor derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.\n\n58\n\n**Fair Value Measurements**\n\nWe account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:\n\n- _Level 1 \u2013_ inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our Level 1 investments include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges.",

Our Level 1 investments include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges.\n\n- _Level 2_    - inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain cleared swap contracts and over-the-counter forward, option, and swap contracts.\n\n- _Level 3_    - inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management\u2019s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds, municipal securities, and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.\n\nWe measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.\n\nOur other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.\n\n**Inventories**",

Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.\n\n**Property and Equipment**\n\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three years; computer equipment, two to six years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not depreciated.\n\n**Leases**\n\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.",

Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized\nat commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do\nnot provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest\nfor collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease\nROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include\noptions to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease\nexpense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For\ncertain equipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease\ncomponent. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the\noperating lease ROU assets and liabilities.\n\n**Goodwill**\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating\nsegment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that\nwould more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.\n\n**Intangible Assets**\n\nOur intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their\nestimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 20 years.

We monitor our foreign\ncurrency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions.\n\nForeign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated investments are hedged using foreign\nexchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. Foreign currency risks related to\ncertain Euro-denominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash\nflow hedging instruments.\n\nCertain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in\nforeign exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures.\n\n**Interest Rate**\n\nInterest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair\nvalue hedging instruments to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates.",

We assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokia\u2019s Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (\u201cFCC Guidelines\u201d) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industrywide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines.",

In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants\u2019 motion to exclude the plaintiffs\u2019 general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which were stricken by the court. A hearing on general causation took place in September of 2022. In April of 2023, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion to strike the testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 experts that cell phones cause brain cancer and entered an order excluding all of plaintiffs\u2019 experts from testifying.\n\n**Irish Data Protection Commission Matter**\n\nIn 2018, the Irish Data Protection Commission (\u201cIDPC\u201d) began investigating a complaint against LinkedIn as to whether LinkedIn\u2019s targeted advertising practices violated the recently implemented European Union General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d). Microsoft cooperated throughout the period of inquiry. In April 2023, the IDPC\n\n79\n\nprovided LinkedIn with a non-public preliminary draft decision alleging GDPR violations and proposing a fine.

Given the complexity and the subjective nature of the transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the IRS, evaluating management\u2019s estimates relating to their determination of uncertain tax positions required extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment, including involvement of our tax specialists.\n\n88\n\n_How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit_\n\nOur principal audit procedures to evaluate management\u2019s estimates of uncertain tax positions related to unresolved transfer pricing issues included the following:\n\n- We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management\u2019s methods and assumptions used in the identification, recognition, measurement, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions, which included testing the effectiveness of the related internal controls.\n\n- We read and evaluated management\u2019s documentation, including relevant accounting policies and information obtained by management from outside tax specialists, that detailed the basis of the uncertain tax positions.\n\n- We tested the reasonableness of management\u2019s judgments regarding the future resolution of the uncertain tax positions, including an evaluation of the technical merits of the uncertain tax positions.\n\n- For those uncertain tax positions that had not been effectively settled, we evaluated whether management had appropriately considered new information that could significantly change the recognition, measurement or disclosure of the uncertain tax positions.",

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n**Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting**",

        "text": "**Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting**\n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n/S/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\n\nSeattle, Washington\nJuly 27, 2023\n\n91\n\n**DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION**\n\nDIRECTORS\n\n**Satya Nadella**\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer,\nMicrosoft Corporation\n\n**Sandra E.
