Despite 2022 being one of the harder macroeconomic years in recent memory,\nand with some of our own operating challenges to boot, we still found a way to grow demand (on top of\nthe unprecedented growth we experienced in the first half of the pandemic). We innovated in our largest\nbusinesses to meaningfully improve customer experience short and long term. And, we made important\nadjustments in our investment decisions and the way in which we\u2019ll invent moving forward, while still\npreserving the long-term investments that we believe can change the future of Amazon for customers,\nshareholders, and employees.\n\nWhile there were an unusual number of simultaneous challenges this past year, the reality is that if you\noperate in large, dynamic, global market segments with many capable and well-funded competitors (the\nconditions in which Amazon operates all of its businesses), conditions rarely stay stagnant for long.\n\nIn the 25 years I\u2019ve been at Amazon, there has been constant change, much of which we\u2019ve initiated ourselves.\nWhen I joined Amazon in 1997, we had booked $15M in revenue in 1996, were a books-only retailer, did\nnot have a third-party marketplace, and only shipped to addresses in the US. Today, Amazon sells nearly every\nphysical and digital retail item you can imagine, with a vibrant third-party seller ecosystem that accounts\nfor 60% of our unit sales, and reaches customers in virtually every country around the world. Similarly,\nbuilding a business around a set of technology infrastructure services in the cloud was not obvious in 2003\nwhen we started pursuing AWS, and still wasn\u2019t when we launched our first services in 2006. Having virtually\nevery book at your fingertips in 60 seconds, and then being able to store and retrieve them on a lightweight\ndigital reader was not \u201ca thing\u201d yet when we launched Kindle in 2007, nor was a voice-driven personal assistant\nlike Alexa (launched in 2014) that you could use to access entertainment, control your smart home, shop,\nand retrieve all sorts of information.",

        "text": "There have also been times when macroeconomic conditions or operating inefficiencies have presented us with new challenges. For instance, in the 2001 dot-com crash, we had to secure letters of credit to buy inventory for the holidays, streamline costs to deliver better profitability for the business, yet still prioritized the long-term customer experience and business we were trying to build (if you remember, we actually lowered prices in most of our categories during that tenuous 2001 period). You saw this sort of balancing again in 2008-2009 as we endured the recession provoked by the mortgage-backed securities financial crisis. We took several actions to manage the cost structure and efficiency of our Stores business, but we also balanced this streamlining with investment in customer experiences that we believed could be substantial future businesses with strong returns for shareholders. In 2008, AWS was still a fairly small, fledgling business. We knew we were on to something, but it still required substantial capital investment. There were voices inside and outside of the company questioning why Amazon (known mostly as an online retailer then) would be investing so much in cloud computing. But, we knew we were inventing something special that could create a lot of value for customers and Amazon in the future. We had a head start on potential competitors; and if anything, we wanted to accelerate our pace of innovation. We made the long-term decision to continue investing in AWS. Fifteen years later, AWS is now an $85B annual revenue run rate business, with strong profitability, that has transformed how customers from start-ups to multinational companies to public sector organizations manage their technology infrastructure. Amazon would be a different company if we\u2019d slowed investment in AWS during that 2008-2009 period.\n\nChange is always around the corner. Sometimes, you proactively invite it in, and sometimes it just comes a-knocking. But, when you see it\u2019s coming, you have to embrace it.

In some cases, it led to us shuttering certain businesses. For instance, we stopped pursuing physical store concepts like our Bookstores and 4 Star stores, closed our Amazon Fabric and Amazon Care efforts, and moved on from some newer devices where we didn\u2019t see a path to meaningful returns. In other cases, we looked at some programs that weren\u2019t producing the returns we\u2019d hoped (e.g. free shipping for all online grocery orders over $35) and amended them. We also reprioritized where to spend our resources, which ultimately led to the hard decision to eliminate 27,000 corporate roles. There are a number of other changes that we\u2019ve made over the last several months to streamline our overall costs, and like most leadership teams, we\u2019ll continue to evaluate what we\u2019re seeing in our business and proceed adaptively.",

        "text": "We also looked hard at **how we were working together as a team and asked our corporate employees to come** **back to the office at least three days a week**, beginning in May. During the pandemic, our employees rallied to get work done from home and did everything possible to keep up with the unexpected circumstances that presented themselves. It was impressive and I\u2019m proud of the way our collective team came together to overcome unprecedented challenges for our customers, communities, and business. But, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best long-term approach. We\u2019ve become convinced that collaborating and inventing is easier and more effective when we\u2019re working together and learning from one another in person. The energy and riffing on one another\u2019s ideas happen more freely, and many of the best Amazon inventions have had their breakthrough moments from people staying behind after a meeting and working through ideas on a whiteboard, or continuing the conversation on the walk back from a meeting, or just popping by a teammate\u2019s office later that day with another thought. Invention is often messy. It wanders and meanders and marinates. Serendipitous interactions help it, and there are more of those in-person than virtually. It\u2019s also significantly easier to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture when we\u2019re in the office together most of the time and surrounded by our colleagues. Innovation and our unique culture have been incredibly important in our first 29 years as a company, and I expect it will be comparably so in the next 29.\n\nA critical challenge we\u2019ve continued to tackle is the rising cost to serve in our Stores fulfillment network (i.e. the cost to get a product from Amazon to a customer)\u2014and **we\u2019ve made several changes that we believe will** **meaningfully improve our fulfillment costs and speed of delivery** .",

This meant that we had to double the fulfillment center footprint that we\u2019d built over the prior 25 years and substantially accelerate building a last-mile transportation network that\u2019s now the size of UPS (along with a new sortation center network to assist with efficiency and speed when items needed to traverse long distances)\u2014all in the span of about two years. This was no easy feat, and hundreds of thousands of Amazonians worked very hard to make this happen. However, not surprisingly, with that rate and scale of change, there was a lot of optimization needed to yield the intended productivity. Over the last several months, we\u2019ve scrutinized every process path in our fulfillment centers and transportation network and redesigned scores of processes and mechanisms, resulting in steady productivity gains and cost reductions over the last few quarters. There\u2019s more work to do, but we\u2019re pleased with our trajectory and the meaningful upside in front of us.",

        "text": "We also took this occasion to make larger structural changes that set us up better to deliver lower costs and faster speed for many years to come. A good example was reevaluating how our US fulfillment network was organized. Until recently, Amazon operated one national US fulfillment network that distributed inventory from fulfillment centers spread across the entire country. If a local fulfillment center didn\u2019t have the product a customer ordered, we\u2019d end up shipping it from other parts of the country, costing us more and increasing delivery times. This challenge became more pronounced as our fulfillment network expanded to hundreds of additional nodes over the last few years, distributing inventory across more locations and increasing the complexity of connecting the fulfillment center and delivery station nodes efficiently. Last year, we started rearchitecting our inventory placement strategy and leveraging our larger fulfillment center footprint to move from a national fulfillment network to a regionalized network model. We made significant internal changes (e.g. placement and logistics software, processes, physical operations) to create eight interconnected regions in smaller geographic areas. Each of these regions has broad, relevant selection to operate in a largely self-sufficient way, while still being able to ship nationally when necessary. Some of the most meaningful and hard work came from optimizing the connections between this large amount of infrastructure. We also continue to improve our advanced machine learning algorithms to better predict what customers in various parts of the country will need so that we have the right inventory in the right regions at the right time. We\u2019ve recently completed this regional roll out and like the early results. Shorter travel distances mean lower cost to serve, less impact on the environment, and customers getting their orders faster. On the latter, we\u2019re excited about seeing more next day and same-day deliveries, and we\u2019re on track to have our fastest Prime delivery speeds ever in 2023. Overall, we remain confident about our plans to lower costs, reduce delivery times, and build a meaningfully larger retail business with healthy operating margins.",

Despite growing 29% year-overyear (\u201cYoY\u201d) in 2022 on a $62B revenue base, AWS faces short-term headwinds right now as companies\nare being more cautious in spending given the challenging, current macroeconomic conditions. While some\ncompanies might obsess over how they could extract as much money from customers as possible in these tight\ntimes, it\u2019s neither what customers want nor best for customers in the long term, so we\u2019re taking a different\ntack. One of the many advantages of AWS and cloud computing is that when your business grows, you can\nseamlessly scale up; and conversely, if your business contracts, you can choose to give us back that capacity\nand cease paying for it. This elasticity is unique to the cloud, and doesn\u2019t exist when you\u2019ve already made\nexpensive capital investments in your own on-premises datacenters, servers, and networking gear. In AWS,\nlike all our businesses, we\u2019re not trying to optimize for any one quarter or year. We\u2019re trying to build customer\nrelationships (and a business) that outlast all of us; and as a result, our AWS sales and support teams are\nspending much of their time helping customers optimize their AWS spend so they can better weather this\nuncertain economy. Many of these AWS customers tell us that they\u2019re not cost-cutting as much as costoptimizing so they can take their resources and apply them to emerging and inventive new customer\nexperiences they\u2019re planning. Customers have appreciated this customer-focused, long-term approach, and\nwe think it\u2019ll bode well for both customers and AWS.",

        "text": "Chip development is a good example. In last year\u2019s letter, I mentioned the investment we were making in our general-purpose CPU processors named Graviton. Graviton2-based compute instances deliver up to 40% better price-performance than the comparable latest generation x86-based instances; and in 2022, we delivered our Graviton3 chips, providing 25% better performance than the Graviton2 processors. Further, as machine learning adoption has continued to accelerate, customers have yearned for lower-cost GPUs (the chips most commonly used for machine learning). AWS started investing years ago in these specialized chips for machine learning training and inference (inferences are the predictions or answers that a machine learning model provides). We delivered our first training chip in 2022 (\u201cTrainium\u201d); and for the most common machine learning models, Trainium-based instances are up to 140% faster than GPU-based instances at up to 70% lower cost. Most companies are still in the training stage, but as they develop models that graduate to large-scale production, they\u2019ll find that most of the cost is in inference because models are trained periodically whereas inferences are happening all the time as their associated application is being exercised. We launched our first inference chips (\u201cInferentia\u201d) in 2019, and they have saved companies like Amazon over a hundred million dollars in capital expense already. Our Inferentia2 chip, which just launched, offers up to four times higher throughput and ten times lower latency than our first Inferentia processor. With the enormous upcoming growth in machine learning, customers will be able to get a lot more done with AWS\u2019s training and inference chips at a significantly lower cost. We\u2019re not close to being done innovating here, and this long-term investment should prove fruitful for both customers and AWS. AWS is still in the early stages of its evolution, and has a chance for unusual growth in the next decade.\n\n**Similarly high potential, Amazon\u2019s Advertising business is uniquely effective for brands, which is part of why it** **continues to grow at a brisk clip** .

Similar to how other mass merchants entered the grocery space in the 1980s, we began by adding products typically found in supermarket aisles that don\u2019t require temperature control such as paper products, canned and boxed food, candy and snacks, pet care, health and personal care, and beauty.

While we\u2019re pleased with the size and growth of our grocery business, we aspire to serve more of our customers\u2019 grocery needs than we do today. To do so, we need a broader physical store footprint given that most of the grocery shopping still happens in physical venues. Whole Foods Market pioneered the natural and organic specialty grocery store concept 40 years ago. Today, it\u2019s a large and growing business that continues to raise the bar for healthy and sustainable food. Over the past year, we\u2019ve continued to invest in the business while also making changes to drive better profitability. Whole Foods is on an encouraging path, but to have a larger impact on physical grocery, we must find a mass grocery format that we believe is worth expanding broadly.

We believe\nthat we\u2019ve only scratched the surface of what\u2019s possible to date, and plan to keep building the features our\nbusiness customers tell us they need and want.\n\nWhile many brands and merchants successfully sell their products on Amazon\u2019s marketplace, there are also\na large number of brands and sellers who have launched their own direct-to-consumer websites. One of the\nchallenges for these merchants is driving conversion from views to purchases. We invented **Buy with Prime**\nto help with this challenge. Buy with Prime allows third-party brands and sellers to offer their products on\ntheir own websites to our large Amazon Prime membership, and offer those customers fast, free Prime shipping\nand seamless checkout with their Amazon account. Buy with Prime provides merchants several additional\nbenefits, including Amazon handling the product storage, picking, packing, delivery, payment, and any\nreturns, all through Amazon Pay and Fulfillment by Amazon. Buy with Prime has recently been made\navailable to all US merchants; and so far, Buy with Prime has increased shopper conversion on third-party\nshopping sites by 25% on average. Merchants are excited about converting more sales and fulfilling these\nshipments more easily, Prime members love that they can use their Prime benefits on more destinations,\nand Buy with Prime allows us to improve the shopping experience across more of the web.",

        "text": "Expanding internationally, pursuing large retail market segments that are still nascent for Amazon, and using our unique assets to help merchants sell more effectively on their own websites are somewhat natural extensions for us. There are also a few investments we\u2019re making that are further from our core businesses, but where we see unique opportunity. In 2003, AWS would have been a classic example. In 2023, Amazon Healthcare and Kuiper are potential analogues.\n\nOur initial efforts in **Healthcare** began with pharmacy, which felt less like a major departure from ecommerce. For years, Amazon customers had asked us when we\u2019d offer them an online pharmacy as their frustrations mounted with current providers. Launched in 2020, Amazon Pharmacy is a full-service, online pharmacy that offers transparent pricing, easy refills, and savings for Prime members. The business is growing quickly, and continues to innovate. An example is Amazon Pharmacy\u2019s recent launch of RxPass, which for a $5 per month flat fee, enables Prime members to get as many of the eligible prescription medications as they need for dozens of common conditions, like high blood pressure, acid reflux, and anxiety. However, our customers have continued to express a strong desire for Amazon to provide a better alternative to the inefficient and unsatisfying broader healthcare experience. We decided to start with primary care as it\u2019s a prevalent first stop in the patient journey. We evaluated and studied the existing landscape extensively, including some early Amazon experiments like Amazon Care. During this process, we identified One Medical\u2019s patient-focused experience as an excellent foundation upon which to build our future business; and in July 2022, we announced our acquisition of One Medical. There are several elements that customers love about One Medical. It has a fantastic digital app that makes it easy for patients to discuss issues with a medical practitioner via chat or video conference. If a physical visit is required, One Medical has offices in cities across the US where patients can book same or next day appointments. One Medical has relationships with specialty physicians in each of its cities and works closely with local hospital systems to make seeing specialists easy, so One Medical members can quickly access these resources when needed. Going forward, we strongly believe that One Medical and Amazon will continue to innovate together to change what primary care will look like for customers.",

        "text": "**Kuiper** is another example of Amazon innovating for customers over the long term in an area where there\u2019s high customer need. Our vision for Kuiper is to create a low-Earth orbit satellite system to deliver high-quality broadband internet service to places around the world that don\u2019t currently have it. There are hundreds of millions of households and businesses who don\u2019t have reliable access to the internet. Imagine what they\u2019ll be able to do with reliable connectivity, from people taking online education courses, using financial services, starting their own businesses, doing their shopping, enjoying entertainment, to businesses and governments improving their coverage, efficiency, and operations. Kuiper will deliver not only accessibility, but affordability. Our teams have developed low-cost antennas (i.e. customer terminals) that will lower the barriers to access. We recently unveiled the new terminals that will communicate with the satellites passing overhead, and we expect to be able to produce our standard residential version for less than $400 each. They\u2019re small: 11 inches square, 1 inch thick, and weigh less than 5 pounds without their mounting bracket, but they deliver speeds up to 400 megabits per second. And they\u2019re powered by Amazon-designed baseband chips. We\u2019re preparing to launch two prototype satellites to test the entire end-to-end communications network this year, and plan to be in beta with commercial customers in 2024. The customer reaction to what we\u2019ve shared thus far about Kuiper has been very positive, and we believe Kuiper represents a very large potential opportunity for Amazon. It also shares several similarities to AWS in that it\u2019s capital intensive at the start, but has a large prospective consumer, enterprise, and government customer base, significant revenue and operating profit potential, and relatively few companies with the technical and inventive aptitude, as well as the investment hypothesis to go after it.",

Machine learning has been a technology with high promise for several decades, but it\u2019s only been the last five to ten years that it\u2019s started to be used more pervasively by companies. This shift was driven by several factors, including access to higher volumes of compute capacity at lower prices than was ever available. Amazon has been using machine learning extensively for 25 years, employing it in everything from personalized ecommerce recommendations, to fulfillment center pick paths, to drones for Prime Air, to Alexa, to the many machine learning services AWS offers (where AWS has the broadest machine learning functionality and customer base of any cloud provider). More recently, a newer form of machine learning, called Generative AI, has burst onto the scene and promises to significantly accelerate machine learning adoption. Generative AI is based on very Large Language Models (trained on up to hundreds of billions of parameters, and growing), across expansive datasets, and has radically general and broad recall and learning capabilities. We have been working on our own LLMs for a while now, believe it will transform and improve virtually every customer experience, and will continue to invest substantially in these models across all of our consumer, seller, brand, and creator experiences. Additionally, as we\u2019ve done for years in AWS, we\u2019re democratizing this technology so companies of all sizes can leverage Generative AI. AWS is offering the most price-performant machine learning chips in Trainium and Inferentia so small and large companies can afford to train and run their LLMs in production. We enable companies to choose from various LLMs and build applications with all of the AWS security, privacy and other features that customers are accustomed to using. And, we\u2019re delivering applications like AWS\u2019s CodeWhisperer, which revolutionizes",

I could write an entire letter on LLMs and Generative AI as I think they will be that transformative, but I\u2019ll leave that for a future letter. Let\u2019s just say that LLMs and Generative AI are going to be a big deal for customers, our shareholders, and Amazon.\n\nSo, in closing, I\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019ll emerge from this challenging macroeconomic time in a stronger position than when we entered it. There are several reasons for it and I\u2019ve mentioned many of them above. But, there are two relatively simple statistics that underline our immense future opportunity. While we have a consumer business that\u2019s $434B in 2022, the vast majority of total market segment share in global retail still resides in physical stores (roughly 80%). And, it\u2019s a similar story for Global IT spending, where we have AWS revenue of $80B in 2022, with about 90% of Global IT spending still on-premises and yet to migrate to the cloud. As these equations steadily flip\u2014as we\u2019re already seeing happen\u2014we believe our leading customer experiences, relentless invention, customer focus, and hard work will result in significant growth in the coming years. And, of course, this doesn\u2019t include the other businesses and experiences we\u2019re pursuing at Amazon, all of which are still in their early days.\n\nI strongly believe that our best days are in front of us, and I look forward to working with my teammates at Amazon to make it so.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAndy Jassy\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nAmazon.com, Inc.\n\nP.S.

Today, online commerce saves\ncustomers money and precious time. Tomorrow, through personalization, online commerce will accelerate the\nvery process of discovery. Amazon.com uses the Internet to create real value for its customers and, by doing so,\nhopes to create an enduring franchise, even in established and large markets.\n\nWe have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity\nand as customers, new to purchasing online, are receptive to forming new relationships. The competitive\nlandscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace. Many large players have moved online with credible offerings\nand have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness, traffic, and sales.

This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position.\nThe stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model.

We will continue to learn from both our successes and our failures.\n\n- We will make bold rather than timid investment decisions where we see a sufficient probability of gaining market leadership advantages. Some of these investments will pay off, others will not, and we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case.\n\n- When forced to choose between optimizing the appearance of our GAAP accounting and maximizing the present value of future cash flows, we\u2019ll take the cash flows.\n\n- We will share our strategic thought processes with you when we make bold choices (to the extent competitive pressures allow), so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rational long-term leadership investments.\n\n- We will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture. We understand the importance of continually reinforcing a cost-conscious culture, particularly in a business incurring net losses.\n\n- We will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long-term profitability and capital management.

We realized that the Web was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simply could not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection than was possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy-to-search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offer customers gift certificates, 1-Click [SM] shopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and recommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leader in online bookselling.\n\nBy many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997:",

Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the single most important element of Amazon.com\u2019s success.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, \u201cYou can work long, hard, or smart, but at Amazon.com you can\u2019t choose two out of three\u201d), but we are working to build something important, something that matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about.

Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base. This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience, selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time we believe that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities to better serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience. To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but in prioritizing our investments.\n\nWe now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have so much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. The challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several: aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks of product and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity. However, as we\u2019ve long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove to be a very large market, and it\u2019s likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit.

In each of our\nsegments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, content creators,\nadvertisers, and employees.\n\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services\n(\u201cAWS\u201d). These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations.\nInformation on our net sales is contained in Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \u2014 Note 10 \u2014\nSegment Information.\u201d\n\n**Consumers**\n\nWe serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We design\nour stores to enable hundreds of millions of unique products to be sold by us and by third parties across dozens of product\ncategories. Customers access our offerings through our websites, mobile apps, Alexa, devices, streaming, and physically\nvisiting our stores. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices, including Kindle, Fire tablet, Fire TV, Echo, Ring, Blink,\nand eero, and we develop and produce media content. We seek to offer our customers low prices, fast and free delivery, easyto-use functionality, and timely customer service. In addition, we offer subscription services such as Amazon Prime, a\nmembership program that includes fast, free shipping on millions of items, access to award-winning movies and series, and\nother benefits.\n\nWe fulfill customer orders in a number of ways, including through: North America and International fulfillment networks\nthat we operate; co-sourced and outsourced arrangements in certain countries; digital delivery; and through our physical stores.\nWe operate customer service centers globally, which are supplemented by co-sourced arrangements.

The worldwide\nmarketplace in which we compete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from\nmany different industry sectors around the world. Our current and potential competitors include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and\nomnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we offer and sell to\nconsumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and\nall distribution channels; (3) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, and other online\nand app-based means of discovering, using, or acquiring goods and services, either directly or in collaboration with other\nretailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website development and hosting, omnichannel sales,\ninventory and supply chain management, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing; (5) companies that\nprovide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or offline; (6) companies that\nprovide information technology services or products, including on-premises or cloud-based infrastructure and other services;\n(7) companies that design, manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, telecommunication, and electronic devices; (8)\ncompanies that sell grocery products online and in physical stores; and (9) companies that provide advertising services, whether\nin digital or other formats. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail businesses include selection, price, and\nconvenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include\nthe quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers\u2019 ability and willingness to change business\npractices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brand\nrecognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers,\nadopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to\ntheir own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive terms, and devote more resources to technology,\ninfrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances\nthe ability of new, smaller, or lesser-known businesses to compete against us. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid\nchange and the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also\nmay enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.",

In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices continue to increase our competition. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser known businesses to compete against us. As a result of competition, our product and service offerings may not be successful, we may fail to gain or may lose business, and we may be required to increase our spending or lower prices, any of which could materially reduce our sales and profits.\n\n_**Our Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks**_\n\nWe may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings. These offerings, which can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience, or are otherwise impacted by, service disruptions, delays, setbacks, or failures or quality issues.

Our international operations may not become profitable on a sustained basis.\n\nIn addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\n- local economic and political conditions;\n\n- government regulation (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition); restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs); nationalization; and restrictions on foreign ownership;\n\n- restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content, including uncertainty as a result of less Internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights;\n\n- business licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices;\n\n- limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;\n\n- limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure;\n\n- shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow;\n\n- laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, payments, advertising, and restrictions on pricing or discounts;\n\n- lower levels of use of the Internet;\n\n- lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.;\n\n- lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk;\n\n- difficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;\n\n- different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions;\n\n- compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties;\n\n- laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and\n\n- geopolitical events, including war and terrorism.",

For example, in order to meet local ownership, regulatory licensing, and cybersecurity requirements, we provide\ncertain technology services in China through contractual relationships with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide\nservices. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online\nmulti-brand retail trading activities.

For example, we expect a disproportionate amount of our retail sales to occur\nduring our fourth quarter. Our failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet\ncustomer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. When we overstock products, we may be\nrequired to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could materially reduce\nprofitability. We regularly experience increases in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and\nadditional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too many customers access our\nwebsites within a short period of time due to increased demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites\nunavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the\nattractiveness of our products and services. In addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and\ncustomer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service cosourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand.

We may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities, including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. Such changes could come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions. An increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes, targeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and services. These include new obligations to withhold or collect sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations. For example, non-U.S. jurisdictions have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues. Proliferation of these or similar unilateral tax measures may continue unless broader international tax reform is implemented. Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional taxes imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide information about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies. In some cases we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date.\n\nOur tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special or extraterritorial tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, and changes in our tax assets and liabilities and their\n\n15",

Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numerous product categories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, advertising, publishing, and digital content subscriptions.\n\n_Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows._ Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives, including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer experience. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, producing original content, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust.

Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our online stores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment network. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture.\n\n_We seek to turn inventory quickly and collect from consumers before our payments to vendors and sellers become due._ Because consumers primarily use credit cards in our stores, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, supply chain disruptions and resulting vendor lead times, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment and other terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers.",

Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting estimates addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \u2014 Note 1 \u2014 Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.\u201d Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.\n\n_Inventories_\n\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2022, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $390 million.",

We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we use more expensive shipping methods, including faster delivery, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies.

The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances\nassociated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon\nconsolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and\nwe may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net\nsales decreased by $15.0 billion in comparison with the prior year.\n\nWe have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (\u201cforeign\nfunds\u201d). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2022, of $18.3 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20%\nadverse change to foreign exchange would result in declines of $915 million, $1.8 billion, and $3.7 billion.\n\nWe also have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies.\nBased on the intercompany balances as of December 31, 2022, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign\nexchange rates would result in losses of $275 million, $555 million, and $1.1 billion, recorded to \u201cOther income (expense),\nnet.\u201d",

As a result, significant judgment\nis required in evaluating the Company\u2019s tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. The\nCompany uses significant judgment in (1) determining whether a tax position\u2019s technical merits are more\nlikely than not to be sustained and (2) measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company reported accrued liabilities of $4.0 billion for various tax\ncontingencies.\n\nAuditing the recognition and measurement of the Company\u2019s tax contingencies was challenging because\nthe evaluation of whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the\nbenefit of various tax positions can be complex and involves significant auditor judgment.

We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology\nservices, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services. We also manufacture and\nsell electronic devices. In addition, we provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through\nprograms such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising.\n\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS.

Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated.\n\n_**Use of Estimates**_\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, impairment of property and equipment and operating leases, valuation and impairment of investments, self-insurance liabilities, and viewing patterns of capitalized video content. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. We review the useful lives of equipment on an ongoing basis, and effective January 1, 2022 we changed our estimate of the useful lives for our servers from four years to five years and for our networking equipment from five years to six years. The longer useful lives are due to continuous improvements in our hardware, software, and data center designs. The effect of this change in estimate for the year ended December 31, 2022, based on servers and networking equipment that were included in \u201cProperty and equipment, net\u201d as of December 31, 2021 and those acquired during the year ended December 31, 2022, was a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of $3.6 billion and a benefit to net loss of $2.8 billion, or $0.28 per basic share and $0.28 per diluted share.",

We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.\n\nWe utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense.\n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:\n\nLevel 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.\n\nLevel 2 - Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\n\nLevel 3 - Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants.

On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on that decision the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately \u20ac250 million, plus interest, for the period May 2006 through June 2014, and ordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission\u2019s decision, which we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission\u2019s decision. In May 2018, we appealed. On May 12, 2021, the European Union General Court annulled the European Commission\u2019s state aid decision. In July 2021, the European Commission appealed the decision to the European Court of Justice. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.\n\nChanges in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact our tax contingencies. Due to various factors, including the inherent complexities and uncertainties of the judicial, administrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the timing of the resolution of income tax controversies is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax controversies in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years\u2019 tax filings.
