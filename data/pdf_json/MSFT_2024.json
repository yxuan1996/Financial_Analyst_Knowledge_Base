        "text": "Dear shareholders, colleagues, customers, and partners:\n\nFiscal year 2024 was a pivotal year for Microsoft. We entered our 50th year as a company and the second year of the AI platform shift. With these milestones, I\u2019ve found myself reflecting on how Microsoft has remained a consequential company decade after decade in an industry with no franchise value. And I realize that it\u2019s because\u2014time and time again, when tech paradigms have shifted\u2014we have seized the opportunity to reinvent ourselves to stay relevant to our customers, our partners, and our employees. And that\u2019s what we are doing again today.\n\nMicrosoft has been a platform and tools company from the start. We were founded in 1975 with a belief in creating technology that would enable others to create their own. And, nearly 50 years later, this belief remains at the heart of our mission to **empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.**\n\nThis year, we moved from talking about AI to helping our customers translate it into real outcomes\u2014one person, one organization, one institution, and one country at a time. We have made remarkable progress on this front across every industry. For example:\n\n- Coles is generating 1.6 billion daily AI predictions across 850 Australian stores, ensuring every shopper finds what they need.\n\n- Unilever is performing thousands of simulations with AI in the time it would take to run tens of laboratory experiments, as it accelerates its product development.\n\n- Developers at Ita\u00fa, Brazil\u2019s largest private bank, are coding more efficiently using our AI pair programmer, GitHub Copilot.\n\n- Khan Academy is making tutoring more accessible for students and helping teachers plan more creative lessons, using our small language model Phi.\n\n- Aquafarmers in Indonesia are improving their yields, thanks to an app built with the Azure OpenAI Service, as well as Azure IoT.\n\n- In Kenya, street vendors now have access to credit for the first time, thanks to M-Kopa, a social enterprise using Azure ML to do its forecasting.\n\n- And enterprise customers and their employees around the world, from Amgen and Disney, to Finastra and Vodafone, are using Microsoft 365 Copilot to become more creative and productive.",

We delivered over $245 billion in annual revenue, up 16 percent year-over-year, and over $109 billion in operating income, up 24 percent.\n\nGoing forward, we are focused on three priorities: First, prioritizing fundamentals, with security above all else. We launched the Secure Future Initiative (SFI) this year, bringing together every part of our organization to advance cybersecurity protection. Second, driving trustworthy AI innovation across our entire portfolio while continuing to scale our cloud business. And, finally, managing our cost structure dynamically to generate durable, long-term operating leverage. All three priorities are critical to our ability to continue thriving as a company as we raise the bar on our operational excellence, with a focus on continuous improvement across everything we do.\n\n**AGE OF AI**\n\nIf we go back 70 years to the beginning of modern computing, our industry has had two dreams: First, can computers understand us instead of us having to understand computers? And second, as we digitize more of the world\u2014including people, places, and things\u2014can computers help us reason, plan, and act more effectively using all that information? Over the past year, we have had breakthroughs on both fronts.\n\nThe core underlying force behind these breakthroughs is scaling laws. Just like Moore\u2019s Law drove the information revolution, the scaling laws of deep neural networks (DNN) and transformers are driving today\u2019s AI revolution. Up until the DNN inflection point, progress in compute was keeping up with Moore\u2019s Law\u2014doubling every two years. But we have now started to see progress in AI performance double roughly every six months.",

First, we have a new natural user\ninterface that is multimodal. It supports speech, images, and videos\u2014both as input and output. We have memory\nthat retains important context, recalling both our personal knowledge and data across devices, apps, and the web.\nAnd, finally, we have new reasoning and planning capabilities that help us understand complex context, complete\nend-to-end tasks on our behalf, and reduce our cognitive load.\n\nThis new world is being defined by a rich tapestry of AI agents, which can take action on our behalf, including\npersonal agents across work and life, business process agents, and cross-organizational ones. These agents will be\nable to work in concert as a new input to help make small businesses more productive, make multinationals more\ncompetitive, make the public sector more efficient, and improve health and education outcomes broadly.\n\nMicrosoft has built three leading platforms to help our customers maximize their opportunity in this emerging\nagentic era: Copilot, which you can think of as the new UI for AI\u2014the human interface for this agentic world; the\nCopilot stack, which brings together infrastructure, data, and app services to help customers build their own copilots\nand agents for their own business processes; and a new category of Copilot devices that are purpose-built for this\nnew era, including the Copilot+ PCs we introduced this year.\n\n**OUR OPPORTUNITY**\n\nThe innovation we have driven over the past year matters only if we translate it into enduring value for our\ncustomers. That\u2019s why, across our tech stack, we are focused on helping people and organizations realize the\nbenefits of AI.\n\n_Infrastructure_\n\nThis year, we expanded our cloud and AI capacity, announcing new investments across five continents. These are\nlong-term assets to drive new growth for the next decade and beyond, and ensure communities around the world\nhave access to the compute they need to drive economic growth in this new era.",

These are\nlong-term assets to drive new growth for the next decade and beyond, and ensure communities around the world\nhave access to the compute they need to drive economic growth in this new era.\n\nOur cloud now also offers top performance for AI training and inference and the most diverse selection of AI\naccelerators, including the latest from AMD and NVIDIA, as well as our own first-party silicon, Azure Maia, which we\nintroduced last November.\n\nMore broadly, we continued to see sustained revenue growth from migrations as customers turn to Azure. Azure Arc\nis helping customers streamline their transition, as they secure, develop, and operate workloads with Azure services\nanywhere. We have 36,000 Arc customers, up 90 percent year-over-year. And we remain the hyperscale cloud of\nchoice for SAP and Oracle workloads.\n\n_Data & AI_\n\nAI models are now key building blocks for every application. And with Azure AI, we are building out the app server\nfor the AI age, providing access to the most diverse selection of models to meet customers\u2019 unique cost, latency, and\ndesign considerations. We offer leading frontier models, thanks to our strategic partnership with OpenAI. With Phi-3,\nwhich we announced in April, we offer a family of powerful, small language models. And, with Models as a service,\nwe provide API access to third-party models, including the latest from Cohere, Meta, and Mistral. In total, we have\nover 60,000 Azure AI customers, up nearly 60 percent year-over-year. This year, we also announced a partnership\nwith G42, which will run its AI applications and services on our cloud, as we collaborate to bring our latest AI\ntechnologies to the United Arab Emirates and other countries.",

Our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform provides customers with the broadest capabilities spanning databases, analytics, business intelligence, and governance\u2014along with seamless integration with all our AI services. And Microsoft Fabric, our AI-powered, next-generation data platform we made generally available this year, now has over 14,000 paid customers who can go from data, to insights, to action\u2014all within the same unified SaaS solution.\n\n2\n\n_Digital & app innovation_\n\nFrom GitHub to Visual Studio, we have the most comprehensive developer tools. GitHub Copilot had a breakout year, as it became standard issue for developers in every industry. We now have more than 1.8 million paid subscribers and over 77,000 enterprise customers, up 180 percent year-over-year. They are realizing productivity gains of up to 55 percent while staying in their flow and bringing the joy back to coding. This year, we also introduced Copilot Workspace, a Copilot-native developer environment, which helps any developer go from idea, to code, to software\u2014all in natural language.\n\nWe are also integrating generative AI across Power Platform, enabling anyone to use natural language to create apps, automate workflows, or build a website. In total, we now have 48 million monthly active users of Power Platform, up 40 percent year-over-year.\n\n_Modern work_\n\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot is becoming a daily habit for knowledge workers, transforming their work, workflow, and work artifacts. Adoption has been faster than any other new Microsoft 365 suite. And employees at nearly 60 percent of the Fortune 500 now use Copilot to complete tasks faster, hold more effective meetings, and automate business workflows and processes. In fact, internal and external studies show as much as a 70 percent improvement in productivity using generative AI for specific work tasks. And early Microsoft 365 Copilot users were 29 percent faster in a series of general tasks like searching, writing, and summarizing.",

With Pages, which we just announced last month, you can take any information from the web or your work and turn it into a multiplayer, AI-powered canvas. You can ideate with AI and then easily share what you create for collaboration with other people.\n\nAnd with Copilot Studio, customers can extend Copilot with agents and build their own agents that proactively respond to data and events from their own first- and third-party business data. To date, 50,000 organizations have used it. And, just this week, we announced new capabilities that will make it possible for customers to build autonomous agents using Copilot Studio.\n\nMicrosoft Teams remains essential to how hundreds of millions of people meet, call, chat, collaborate, and do business. This year, we rolled out to all customers a new version that is up to two times faster while using 50 percent less memory. And Teams Premium surpassed 3 million seats, up nearly 400 percent year-over-year, as organizations chose it for advanced features like end-to-end encryption and real-time translation.\n\n_Business applications_\n\nWe\u2019re using this AI moment to redefine our role in business applications, too. Dynamics 365 once again took share, as organizations use our AI-powered apps to transform their marketing, sales, service, finance, and supply chain functions.\n\nAnd we are expanding our total addressable market by integrating Copilot into third-party systems as well. Our new Dynamics 365 Contact Center infuses generative AI throughout the contact center workflow in a customer\u2019s existing CRM.\n\nWe are also extending Copilot to specific industries, including healthcare. With DAX Copilot, more than 400 healthcare organizations are increasing physician productivity and reducing burnout. On average, clinicians save more than five minutes per patient encounter. And 77 percent say it also improves documentation quality.\n\n3\n\n_Security_",

We are doubling down on our Secure Future Initiative, as we implement our principles of secure by design, secure by default, and secure operations. And we are focused on making continuous progress across the six pillars of the initiative: protect tenants and isolate production systems; protect identities and secrets; protect networks; protect engineering systems; monitor and detect threats; and accelerate response and remediation. As part of this commitment, all Microsoft employees now have security as a \u201ccore priority,\u201d holding each one of us accountable for building secure products and services.\n\nWe are continuously applying what we are learning and translating it into security innovation for our customers. A great example is Copilot for Security, which we made generally available this year. It brings together LLMs with domain-specific skills informed by our threat intelligence and 78 trillion daily security signals to provide security teams with actionable insights.\n\n_Devices & creativity_\n\nThis year, we introduced an entirely new category of Windows PCs engineered to unleash the power of distributed AI across the cloud and edge. Copilot+ PCs are the fastest, most AI-ready Windows PCs ever built. They include a new system architecture designed to deliver best-in-class performance and breakthrough AI experiences. And we are working across our entire ecosystem to bring these to life, including with AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm, along with our OEM partners.\n\n_Professional social network_\n\nLinkedIn continues to see accelerated member growth and record engagement. We surpassed 1 billion members for the first time this year, as we combine our unique data with this new generation of AI to transform how people learn, sell, and get hired. LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to be a leader in B2B digital advertising, helping companies deliver the right message, to the right audience, on a safe and trusted platform. And when it comes to our subscription businesses, Premium signups increased 51 percent, and we are adding even more value to our members and customers with new AI tools and skilling opportunities.\n\n_Search, ads, and news_",

They keep us grounded, serving as a guide as we make decisions, pushing us to ask critical questions to ensure the technology we create benefits everyone on the planet, as well as the planet itself.\n\n_How can we expand opportunity?_\n\nWe are democratizing access to AI and the skills needed to harness its potential, ensuring that every person, organization, and community can benefit from the opportunities AI brings.\n\nThis year, we partnered with 375,000 nonprofits globally, providing $4.7 billion in donated and discounted technology\u2014to help them build capacity, drive efficiencies, innovate, and increase their impact as they take on the world\u2019s greatest challenges. Together with our partners, we also made significant strides in skilling. We have trained and certified 14.1 million people across 202 countries in digital skills as of June 2024. Over 80 percent of the learners were from groups furthest from opportunity in the digital economy.\n\nAnd our work doesn\u2019t stop there. We must do more to accelerate the equitable adoption of AI and narrow the digital divide. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve launched new AI skilling initiatives in partnership with governments, educational institutions, industry, and civil society\u2014to help millions of people learn to use generative AI, develop AI tools, and lead AI adoption. This includes people from underserved communities, with a focus on young people, women, rural communities, and the Global South, as well as employees of social impact organizations.\n\n_How can we earn trust?_\n\nWe recognize that trust is earned, not given.

It is the only way we will succeed.\n\nOur growth mindset culture helps us in our continuous pursuit of high performance. It doesn\u2019t matter what we said\nabout our culture 10 years ago or even last year if we aren\u2019t practicing it today\u2014by anticipating the unmet and\nunarticulated needs of customers; by working together as One Microsoft to deliver the best end-to-end solutions\nand services; and by actively seeking diversity and embracing inclusion\u2014to ensure our workforce represents the\nplanet we serve and the products we build always meet our customers\u2019 needs. In our latest Diversity & Inclusion\nReport, we share the ways our longstanding commitment to diversity and inclusion endures, and what we\u2019re learning\nas we continue to hire, develop, and grow a global workforce that best supports each other and our customers.

And our employees volunteered over 1 million hours to causes they care about. I am deeply grateful for my colleagues\u2019 dedication to making a difference. Together, we can continue to empower everyone around the world.\n\n**\n\nIn closing, this is a consequential time for our company, our industry, and the world. Ultimately, our mission requires that we translate technology into empowerment for everyone, into real-world impact. At the end of the day, that\u2019s what really matters.\n\nNearly two years later, I can\u2019t stop thinking about the Indian farmer I met in January 2023. He was able to apply for complex government farm subsidies using just his voice, thanks to an app built with GPT 3.5. It was remarkable. A frontier model developed on the West Coast of the US just months earlier was being used to directly improve the lives of rural farmers on the other side of the globe.\n\n7\n\nThat rate of diffusion was unlike anything I had seen in my career. And the pace has only increased. Earlier this year, I was in Thailand, where I met developers using Phi-3 to optimize their operations just days after the small language model was released.\n\nTo me, that represents the true democratization of expertise. Where the internet era put information at our fingertips, AI is putting expertise at our fingertips. Impact like this is why we are in this industry, and it is what gives all of us at Microsoft deep meaning in our work.\n\nIt is why we are investing in our fundamentals, in our people, and in continued innovation\u2014so that we can help others achieve more for the long term.\n\nIt is not an exaggeration to say that what each of us does right now with the unique opportunity we have been given will shape the future.

At the same time, the infrastructure and\nelectricity needed for these technologies create new challenges for meeting sustainability commitments across the\ntech sector.\n\nIn May 2024, we released our Environmental Sustainability Report which looked back at our progress in several areas\nduring fiscal year 2023. In four areas we are on track, and in each of these we see progress that has the potential to\nhave global impact beyond our own sustainability work. These are:\n\n- Reducing our direct operational emissions (Scope 1 and 2).\n\n- Accelerating carbon removal.\n\n- Designing for circularity to minimize waste and reusing cloud hardware.\n\n- Improving biodiversity and protecting more land than we use.",

We grew our Nonprofit Tech Acceleration for Black and African American\nCommunities program, to help more than 3,000 local organizations in nearly 1,900 Black and African American\ncommunities use technical solutions to modernize and streamline operations. We also expanded our Technology\nEducation and Learning Support (\u201cTEALS\u201d) program to reach nearly 550 high schools across 21 racial equity\nexpansion regions with the support of nearly 1,500 volunteers, 12% of whom identify as Black or African American.\n\nWe have committed $150 million in Minority Depository Institutions and funds supporting Black and African\nAmerican-owned small businesses. These commitments drive sustained impact by directly enabling an increase of\nfunds into local communities, improving diverse, small-business access to capital, and increasing skill development.\nWe continue to partner with diverse-owned banking partners and asset managers to catalyze growth and industry\nparticipation. Additionally, we enriched our supplier pipeline, achieving our goal to spend $500 million with double\nthe number of Black- and African American-owned suppliers.

This initiative brings together classes, Career Essentials Certificates, and other resources from LinkedIn, GitHub, and Microsoft Learn, and is built on data insights drawn from LinkedIn\u2019s Economic Graph. Our goal was to train and certify 10 million learners by 2025. As of May 2024, we have surpassed that goal, training and certifying 12.6 million learners. We also launched a campaign in the United States in 2021 to help skill and recruit 250,000 people into the nation\u2019s cybersecurity workforce by 2025, representing half of the country\u2019s workforce shortage. To that end, we are making curriculum available free of charge to all of the nation\u2019s higher education institutions, providing training for new and existing faculty, and providing scholarships and supplemental resources to 25,000 students. The cyber skills initiative has expanded to 27 additional countries that show elevated cyberthreat risks coupled with significant gaps in their cybersecurity workforces, where we\u2019ve partnered with nonprofits and other educational institutions to train the next generation of cybersecurity workers.\n\n16\n\nGenerative AI is creating unparalleled opportunities to empower workers globally, but only if everyone has the skills to use it. In June 2023, we launched an AI Skills initiative to help everyone learn how to harness the power of AI. This includes a new LinkedIn learning pathway offering new coursework on learning the foundations of generative AI. We also launched a new global grant challenge to uncover new ways of training workers on generative AI and provide greater access to digital learning events and resources. Additionally, we extended our reach in rural communities, including through our TechSpark initiative in the United States.

Xbox is designed to benefit users by providing access to a network of certified applications and services and to benefit our developer and partner ecosystems by providing access to a large customer base. Xbox revenue is mainly affected by subscriptions and sales of first- and third-party content, as well as advertising. Growth of our Gaming business is determined by the overall active user base through Xbox enabled content, availability of games, providing exclusive game content that gamers seek, the computational power and reliability of the devices used to access our content and services, and the ability to create new experiences.\n\n22\n\n_**Search and News Advertising**_\n\nOur Search and news advertising business is designed to deliver relevant search, native, and display advertising to a global audience. Our Microsoft Edge browser and Bing search engine with Copilot are key tools to enable user acquisition and engagement, while our technology platform enables accelerated delivery of digital advertising solutions. In addition to first-party tools, we have several partnerships with companies, such as Yahoo, through which we provide and monetize search offerings. Growth depends on our ability to attract new users, understand intent, and match intent with relevant content on advertising offerings.\n\n_Competition_\n\nWindows faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and devices, mainly from Apple and Google, and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint competes with CrowdStrike on endpoint security solutions. We believe Windows competes effectively by giving customers choice, value, flexibility, security, an easy-to-use interface, and compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications, including those that enable productivity.\n\nDevices face competition from various computer, tablet, and hardware manufacturers who offer a unique combination of high-quality industrial design and innovative technologies across various price points. These manufacturers, many of which are also current or potential partners and customers, include Apple and our Windows OEMs.",

The framework is designed to help us maintain customer trust and confidence in our products, remain in compliance with regulators around the globe, and effectively scale our capability to address the growing number of complex regulations.\n\n27\n\nThrough the framework, our legal and regulatory subject matter experts ingest regulations, develop standards and implementation guidance, and, when appropriate, work with our engineers to develop and implement products to monitor compliance. Our business teams, with legal support, manage the compliance programs and prepare external regulatory and commercial reporting, and our internal audit teams conduct reviews of our programs and processes. While we intended to create a unified approach to regulatory compliance, some of the programs and processes established pursuant to the framework are tailored to meet specific regulatory obligations, such as with the creation of independent compliance functions required by the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) Digital Markets Act and the EU Digital Services Act, which oversee, monitor, and assess the company\u2019s compliance with these acts.\n\nFor a description of the risks we face related to regulatory matters, refer to Risk Factors in our fiscal year 2024 Form 10-K.\n\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION",

At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad\nrange of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers\nand users, industry trends, and competitive forces.\n\n**Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks**\n\nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors\nare developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and\nbusinesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, influencing how users access services in\nthe cloud and, in some cases, the user\u2019s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. Aggregate demand for\nour software, services, and devices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain\ndynamic. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment.\n\nThe investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating\ncosts and may decrease our operating margins. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our\ndatacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given\nthe growing demand for AI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land,\npredictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (\u201cGPUs\u201d) and other\ncomponents. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our\nproducts, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet\nour requirements. However, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified\nsuppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet\nconsumer demand.\n\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university\nand industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working\nenvironment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one\u2019s career across many different\nproducts and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits.",

We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working\nenvironment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one\u2019s career across many different\nproducts and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits.\n\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue\nand expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates\nmay significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies did\nnot have a material impact on reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2024.\n\nRefer to Risk Factors in our fiscal year 2024 Form 10-K for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\n\n**Seasonality**\n\nOur revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. Fourth quarter\nrevenue is driven by a higher volume of multi-year contracts executed during the period.\n\n**Change in Accounting Estimate**\n\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to\ninvestments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as\nadvances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network\nequipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023.\n\n30\n\n**Reportable Segments**\n\nWe report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes,\nIntelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing.

Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments.

In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee.

We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures.

Critical estimates used in the valuation of intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected cash flows, useful lives, and discount rates.

Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue\nrecognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the\nstandalone selling price (\u201cSSP\u201d) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as\nproduct returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of\ngoodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible\nassets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based\ncompensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of\nuncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and\ndetermining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from\nmanagement\u2019s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.\n\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment.

This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023.\n\n**Foreign Currencies**\n\nAssets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.

Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\n\n_Nature of Products and Services_\n\nLicenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license.\n\nCertain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance (\u201cSA\u201d). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time.\n\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided.",

Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided.\n\nOur hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces.\n\nRefer to Note 19 \u2013 Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service offering.\n\n_Significant Judgments_\n\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.\n\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.\n\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.",

Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions, Windows post-delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.\n\nRefer to Note 13 \u2013 Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period.",

Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products.\n\n**Product Warranty**\n\nWe provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.\n\n**Research and Development**\n\nResearch and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to production.

The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our\ncommon stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting\nperiod.

Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive income. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. To determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.\n\nEquity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative).

In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants\u2019 motion to exclude the plaintiffs\u2019 general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which were stricken by the court. A hearing on general causation took place in September of 2022. In April of 2023, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion to strike the testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 experts that cell phones cause brain cancer and entered an order excluding all of plaintiffs\u2019 experts from testifying. The parties agreed to a stipulated dismissal of the consolidated cases to allow plaintiffs to appeal the expert testimony order. Plaintiffs appealed the court\u2019s order in August of 2023, and the parties have filed their briefs on the appeal. A hearing on the status of the stayed cases occurred in December of 2023.

Microsoft cooperated throughout the period of inquiry. In April 2023, the IDPC provided LinkedIn with a non-public preliminary draft decision alleging GDPR violations and proposing a fine. In July 2024, the IDPC provided LinkedIn with a revised non-public draft decision. There is no set timeline for the IDPC to issue a final decision, at which time Microsoft will consider its options to appeal.\n\n**Other Contingencies**",

The Company remains under IRS audit, or subject to IRS audit, for tax years subsequent to 2003. In the current fiscal year, the Company received Notices of Proposed Adjustments (\u201cNOPAs\u201d) for the tax years 2004 to 2013, primarily related to intercompany transfer pricing. While the Company has settled a portion of the IRS audits, resolution of the remaining matters could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial statements.\n\nConclusions on recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions involve significant estimates and management judgment and include complex considerations of the Internal Revenue Code, related regulations, tax case laws, and prior-year audit settlements. Given the complexity and the subjective nature of certain transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the IRS, evaluating management\u2019s estimates relating to their determination of uncertain tax positions required extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment, including involvement of our tax specialists.\n\n_How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit_\n\nOur principal audit procedures to evaluate management\u2019s estimates of uncertain tax positions related to unresolved transfer pricing issues included the following:\n\n- We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management\u2019s methods and assumptions used in the identification, recognition, measurement, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions, which included testing the effectiveness of the related internal controls.\n\n- We read and evaluated management\u2019s documentation, including relevant accounting policies and information obtained by management from outside tax specialists, that detailed the basis of the uncertain tax positions.\n\n- We tested the reasonableness of management\u2019s judgments regarding the future resolution of the uncertain tax positions, including an evaluation of the technical merits of the uncertain tax positions.",

The Company accounted for the Activision Blizzard, Inc., acquisition as a business combination and, accordingly, allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. Identifiable intangible assets acquired included marketing-related intangible assets, technology-based intangible assets, and customer-related intangible assets. The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill.\n\nWe identified the fair value determination of certain marketing-related and technology-based intangible assets for the business combination as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgment required in determining their estimated fair values. Management\u2019s estimates of fair value included assumptions for revenue and expense forecasts and the selection of appropriate discount rates. There was a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in applying audit procedures and evaluating the significant assumptions relating to the estimates, including involvement of our fair value specialists.\n\n_How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit_\n\nOur audit procedures related to management\u2019s estimates of the fair value of certain marketing-related and technology-based intangible assets acquired included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the business combination, including internal controls over the revenue and expense forecasts and the selection of appropriate discount rates.",
