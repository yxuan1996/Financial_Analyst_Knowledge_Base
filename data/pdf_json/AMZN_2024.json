Today, I have even more.\nThe reasons are many, but start with the progress we\u2019ve made in our financial results and customer\nexperiences, and extend to our continued innovation and the remarkable opportunities in front of us.\n\nIn 2023, Amazon\u2019s total revenue grew 12% year-over-year (\u201cYoY\u201d) from $514B to $575B. By segment, North\nAmerica revenue increased 12% YoY from $316B to $353B, International revenue grew 11% YoY from\n$118B to $131B, and AWS revenue increased 13% YoY from $80B to $91B.\n\nFurther, Amazon\u2019s operating income and Free Cash Flow (\u201cFCF\u201d) dramatically improved. Operating\nincome in 2023 improved 201% YoY from $12.2B (an operating margin of 2.4%) to $36.9B (an operating\nmargin of 6.4%). Trailing Twelve Month FCF adjusted for equipment finance leases improved from -$12.8B\nin 2022 to $35.5B (up $48.3B).\n\nWhile we\u2019ve made meaningful progress on our financial measures, what we\u2019re most pleased about is the\ncontinued customer experience improvements across our businesses.\n\nIn our Stores business, customers have enthusiastically responded to our relentless focus on selection, price,\nand convenience. We continue to have the broadest retail selection, with hundreds of millions of products\navailable, tens of millions added last year alone, and several premium brands starting to list on Amazon\n(e.g. Coach, Victoria\u2019s Secret, Pit Viper, Martha Stewart, Clinique, Lanc\u00f4me, and Urban Decay).",

As a result, in Q4 2023, we kicked off the holiday season with Prime\nBig Deal Days, an exclusive event for Prime members to provide an early start on holiday shopping. This\nwas followed by our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event, open to all customers,\nthat became our largest revenue event ever. For all of 2023, customers saved nearly $24B across millions of\ndeals and coupons, almost 70% more than the prior year.\n\nWe also continue to improve delivery speeds, breaking multiple company records. In 2023, Amazon\ndelivered at the fastest speeds ever to Prime members, with more than 7 billion items arriving same or next\nday, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe. In the U.S., this result is the\ncombination of two things. One is the benefit of regionalization, where we re-architected the network to\nstore items closer to customers. The other is the expansion of same-day facilities, where in 2023, we increased\nthe number of items delivered same day or overnight by nearly 70% YoY. As we get items to customers this\nfast, customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs more frequently, and we can see the results in\nvarious areas including how fast our everyday essentials business is growing (over 20% YoY in Q4 2023).",

        "text": "Our regionalization efforts have also trimmed transportation distances, helping lower our cost to serve. In\n2023, for the first time since 2018, we reduced our cost to serve on a per unit basis globally. In the U.S. alone,\ncost to serve was down by more than $0.45 per unit YoY. Decreasing cost to serve allows us both to invest\nin speed improvements and afford adding more selection at lower Average Selling Prices (\u201cASPs\u201d). More\nselection at lower prices puts us in consideration for more purchases.\n\nAs we look toward 2024 (and beyond), we\u2019re not done lowering our cost to serve. We\u2019ve challenged every\nclosely held belief in our fulfillment network, and reevaluated every part of it, and found several areas where\nwe believe we can lower costs even further while also delivering faster for customers. Our inbound fulfillment\narchitecture and resulting inventory placement are areas of focus in 2024, and we have optimism there\u2019s\nmore upside for us.\n\nInternationally, we like the trajectory of our established countries, and see meaningful progress in our\nemerging geographies (e.g. India, Brazil, Australia, Mexico, Middle East, Africa, etc.) as they continue to\n\nexpand selection and features, and move toward profitability (in Q4 2023, Mexico became our latest\ninternational Stores locale to turn profitable). We have high conviction that these new geographies will\ncontinue to grow and be profitable in the long run.\n\nAlongside our Stores business, Amazon\u2019s Advertising progress remains strong, growing 24% YoY from\n$38B in 2022 to $47B in 2023, primarily driven by our sponsored ads. We\u2019ve added Sponsored TV to this\noffering, a self-service solution for brands to create campaigns that can appear on up to 30+ streaming\nTV services, including Amazon Freevee and Twitch, and have no minimum spend. Recently, we\u2019ve expanded\nour streaming TV advertising by introducing ads into Prime Video shows and movies, where brands can\nreach over 200 million monthly viewers in our most popular entertainment offerings, across hit movies and\nshows, award-winning Amazon MGM Originals, and live sports like _Thursday Night Football_ . Streaming\nTV advertising is growing quickly and off to a strong start.",

        "text": "Shifting to AWS, we started 2023 seeing substantial cost optimization, with most companies trying to save money in an uncertain economy. Much of this optimization was catalyzed by AWS helping customers use the cloud more efficiently and leverage more powerful, price-performant AWS capabilities like Graviton chips (our generalized CPU chips that provide ~40% better price-performance than other leading x86 processors), S3 Intelligent Tiering (a storage class that uses AI to detect objects accessed less frequently and store them in less expensive storage layers), and Savings Plans (which give customers lower prices in exchange for longer commitments). This work diminished short-term revenue, but was best for customers, much appreciated, and should bode well for customers and AWS longer-term. By the end of 2023, we saw cost optimization attenuating, new deals accelerating, customers renewing at larger commitments over longer time periods, and migrations growing again.\n\nThe past year was also a significant delivery year for AWS. We announced our next generation of generalized CPU chips (Graviton4), which provides up to 30% better compute performance and 75% more memory bandwidth than its already-leading predecessor (Graviton3). We also announced AWS Trainium2 chips, which will deliver up to four times faster machine learning training for generative AI applications and three times more memory capacity than Trainium1. We continued expanding our AWS infrastructure footprint, now offering 105 Availability Zones within 33 geographic Regions globally, with six new Regions coming (Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and a second German region in Berlin). In Generative AI (\u201cGenAI\u201d), we added dozens of features to Amazon SageMaker to make it easier for developers to build new Foundation Models (\u201cFMs\u201d). We invented and delivered a new service (Amazon Bedrock) that lets companies leverage existing FMs to build GenAI applications. And, we launched the most capable coding assistant around in Amazon Q. Customers are excited about these capabilities, and we\u2019re seeing significant traction in our GenAI offerings. (More on how we\u2019re approaching GenAI and why we believe we\u2019ll be successful later in the letter.)\n\nWe\u2019re also making progress on many of our newer business investments that have the potential to be important to customers and Amazon long-term.

Touching on two of them:\n\nWe have increasing conviction that Prime Video can be a large and profitable business on its own. This confidence is buoyed by the continued development of compelling, exclusive content (e.g. _Thursday Night_ _Football, Lord of the Rings, Reacher, The Boys, Citadel, Road House_, etc.), Prime Video customers\u2019 engagement with this content, growth in our marketplace programs (through our third-party Channels program, as well as the broad selection of shows and movies customers rent or buy), and the addition of advertising in Prime Video.\n\nIn October, we hit a major milestone in our journey to commercialize Project Kuiper when we launched two end-to-end prototype satellites into space, and successfully validated all key systems and sub-systems\u2014rare in an initial launch like this. Kuiper is our low Earth orbit satellite initiative that aims to provide broadband connectivity to the 400-500 million households who don\u2019t have it today (as well as governments and enterprises seeking better connectivity and performance in more remote areas), and is a very large revenue opportunity for Amazon. We\u2019re on track to launch our first production satellites in 2024. We\u2019ve still got a long way to go, but are encouraged by our progress.\n\nOverall, 2023 was a strong year, and I\u2019m grateful to our collective teams who delivered on behalf of customers. These results represent a lot of invention, collaboration, discipline, execution, and reimagination across Amazon. Yet, I think every one of us at Amazon believes that we have a long way to go, in every one of our businesses, before we exhaust how we can make customers\u2019 lives better and easier, and there is considerable upside in each of the businesses in which we\u2019re investing.",

We operate in a diverse number of market segments, but what ties Amazon together is our joint mission to make customers\u2019 lives better and easier every day. This is true across every customer segment we serve (consumers, sellers, brands, developers, enterprises, and creators). At our best, we\u2019re not just customer obsessed, but also inventive, thinking several years out, learning like crazy, scrappy, delivering quickly, and operating like the world\u2019s biggest start-up.\n\nWe spend enormous energy thinking about how to empower builders, inside and outside of our company. We characterize builders as people who like to invent. They like to dissect a customer experience, assess what\u2019s wrong with it, and reinvent it. Builders tend not to be satisfied until the customer experience is perfect. This doesn\u2019t hinder them from delivering improvements along the way, but it drives them to keep tinkering and iterating continually. While unafraid to invent from scratch, they have no hesitation about using high-quality, scalable, cost-effective components from others. What matters to builders is having the right tools to keep rapidly improving customer experiences.\n\nThe best way we know how to do this is by building **primitive services** . Think of them as discrete, foundational building blocks that builders can weave together in whatever combination they desire.

Here\u2019s how we\ndescribed primitives in our 2003 AWS Vision document:\n\n_\u201cPrimitives are the raw parts or the most foundational-level building blocks for software developers. They\u2019re indivisible_\n_(if they can be functionally split into two they must) and they do one thing really well. They\u2019re meant to be used_\n_together rather than as solutions in and of themselves. And, we\u2019ll build them for maximum developer flexibility. We_\n_won\u2019t put a bunch of constraints on primitives to guard against developers hurting themselves. Rather, we\u2019ll optimize for_\n_developer freedom and innovation.\u201d_\n\nOf course, this concept of primitives can be applied to more than software development, but they\u2019re\nespecially relevant in technology. And, over the last 20 years, primitives have been at the heart of how we\u2019ve\ninnovated quickly.\n\n**One of the many advantages to thinking in primitives is speed** . Let me give you two counter examples that\nillustrate this point. First, we built a successful owned-inventory retail business in the early years at Amazon\nwhere we bought all our products from publishers, manufacturers, and distributors, stored them in our\nwarehouses, and shipped them ourselves. Over time, we realized we could add broader selection and lower\nprices by allowing third-party sellers to list their offerings next to our own on our highly trafficked search and\nproduct detail pages. We\u2019d built several core retail services (e.g. payments, search, ordering, browse, item\nmanagement) that made trying different marketplace concepts simpler than if we didn\u2019t have those\ncomponents. A good set of primitives? Not really.",

        "text": "It turns out that these core components were too jumbled together and not partitioned right. We learned this the hard way when we partnered with companies like Target in our Merchant.com business in the early 2000s. The concept was that target.com would use Amazon\u2019s ecommerce components as the backbone of its website, and then customize however they wished. To enable this arrangement, we had to deliver those components as separable capabilities through application programming interfaces (\u201cAPIs\u201d). This decoupling was far more difficult than anticipated because we\u2019d built so many dependencies between these services as Amazon grew so quickly the first few years.\n\nThis coupling was further highlighted by a heavyweight mechanism we used to operate called \u201cNPI.\u201d Any new initiative requiring work from multiple internal teams had to be reviewed by this NPI cabal where each team would communicate how many people-weeks their work would take. This bottleneck constrained what we accomplished, frustrated the heck out of us, and inspired us to eradicate it by refactoring these ecommerce components into true primitive services with well-documented, stable APIs that enabled our builders to use each other\u2019s services without any coordination tax.\n\nIn the middle of the Target and NPI challenges, we were contemplating building a new set of infrastructure technology services that would allow both Amazon to move more quickly and external developers to build anything they imagined. This set of services became known as AWS, and the above experiences convinced us that we should build a set of primitive services that could be composed together how anybody saw fit. At that time, most technology offerings were very feature-rich, and tried to solve multiple jobs simultaneously. As a result, they often didn\u2019t do any one job that well.",

        "text": "Our AWS primitive services were designed from the start to be different. They offered important, highly flexible, but focused functionality. For instance, our first major primitive was Amazon Simple Storage Service (\u201cS3\u201d) in March 2006 that aimed to provide highly secure object storage, at very high durability and availability, at Internet scale, and very low cost. In other words, be stellar at object storage. When we launched S3, developers were excited, and a bit mystified. It was a very useful primitive service, but they wondered, why just object storage? When we launched Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (\u201cEC2\u201d) in August 2006 and Amazon SimpleDB in 2007, people realized we were building a set of primitive infrastructure services that would allow them to build anything they could imagine, much faster, more cost-effectively, and without having to manage or lay out capital upfront for the datacenter or hardware. As AWS unveiled these building blocks over time (we now have over 240 at builders\u2019 disposal\u2014meaningfully more than any other provider), whole companies sprang up quickly on top of AWS (e.g. Airbnb, Dropbox, Instagram, Pinterest, Stripe, etc.), industries reinvented themselves on AWS (e.g. streaming with Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Fox, Paramount), and even critical government agencies switched to AWS (e.g. CIA, along with several other U.S. Intelligence agencies). But, one of the lesser-recognized beneficiaries was Amazon\u2019s own consumer businesses, which innovated at dramatic speed across retail, advertising, devices (e.g. Alexa and FireTV), Prime Video and Music, Amazon Go, Drones, and many other endeavors by leveraging the speed with which AWS let them build. **Primitives, done well, rapidly accelerate builders\u2019 ability to innovate** .\n\nSo, how do you build the right set of primitives?\n\nPursuing primitives is not a guarantee of success.

But, **a good compass is to pick real customer problems you\u2019re trying to solve** .\n\nOur logistics primitives are an instructive example. In Amazon\u2019s early years, we built core capabilities around warehousing items, and then picking, packing, and shipping them quickly and reliably to customers. As we added third-party sellers to our marketplace, they frequently requested being able to use these same logistics capabilities. Because we\u2019d built this initial set of logistics primitives, we were able to introduce Fulfillment by Amazon (\u201cFBA\u201d) in 2006, allowing sellers to use Amazon\u2019s Fulfillment Network to store items, and then have us pick, pack, and ship them to customers, with the bonus of these products being available for fast, Prime delivery. This service has saved sellers substantial time and money (typically about 70% less expensive than doing themselves), and remains one of our most popular services. As more merchants began to operate their own direct-to-consumer (\u201cDTC\u201d) websites, many yearned to still use our fulfillment capabilities, while also accessing our payments and identity primitives to drive higher order conversion on their own websites (as Prime members have already shared this payment and identity information with Amazon). A couple years ago, we launched Buy with Prime to address this customer need. Prime members can check out quickly on DTC websites like they do on Amazon, and receive fast Prime shipping speeds on Buy with Prime items\u2014increasing order conversion for merchants by ~25% vs. their default experience.",

We\u2019ve become adept at getting products from other countries to the U.S., clearing customs, and then shipping to storage facilities. Because we don\u2019t have enough space in our shipping fulfillment centers to store all the inventory needed to maintain our desired in-stock levels, we\u2019ve built a set of lower-cost, upstream warehouses solely optimized for storage (without sophisticated end-user, pick, pack, and ship functions). Having these two pools of inventory has prompted us to build algorithms predicting when we\u2019ll run out of inventory in our shipping fulfillment centers and automatically replenishing from these upstream warehouses. And, in the last few years, our scale and available alternatives have forced us to build our own last mile delivery capability (roughly the size of UPS) to affordably serve the number of consumers and sellers wanting to use Amazon.\n\nWe\u2019ve solved these customer needs by building additional fulfillment primitives that both serve Amazon consumers better and address external sellers\u2019 increasingly complex ecommerce activities. For instance, for sellers needing help importing products, we offer a Global Mile service that leverages our expertise here. To ship inventory from the border (or anywhere domestically) to our storage facilities, we enable sellers to use either our first-party Amazon Freight service or third-party freight partners via our Partnered Carrier Program. To store more inventory at lower cost to ensure higher in-stock rates and shorter delivery times, we\u2019ve opened our upstream Amazon Warehousing and Distribution facilities to sellers (along with automated replenishment to our shipping fulfillment centers when needed). For those wanting to manage their own shipping, we\u2019ve started allowing customers to use our last mile delivery network to deliver packages to their end-customers in a service called Amazon Shipping. And, for sellers who wish to use our fulfillment network as a central place to store inventory and ship items to customers regardless of where they ordered, we have a Multi-Channel Fulfillment service.

Or, you can compose these primitives into external, paid applications as we have with FBA, Buy with Prime, or Supply Chain by Amazon (a recently released logistics service that integrates several of our logistics primitives). But, you\u2019ve got options. You\u2019re only constrained by the primitives you\u2019ve built and your imagination.\n\nTake the new, same-day fulfillment facilities in our Stores business.

These facilities also constitute our lowest cost to serve in the network. The experience has been so positive for customers that we\u2019re planning to double the number of these facilities.\n\nBut, how else might we use this capability if we think of it as a core building block?

It won\u2019t start off being available for all sizes of packages and in all locations, but we believe it\u2019ll be pervasive over time. Think about how the experience of ordering perishable items changes with sub-one-hour delivery?\n\nThe same is true for Amazon Pharmacy. Need throat lozenges, Advil, an antibiotic, or some other medication? Same-day facilities already deliver many of these items within hours, and that will only get shorter as we launch Prime Air more expansively. Highly flexible building blocks can be composed across businesses and in new combinations that change what\u2019s possible for customers.\n\n**Being intentional about building primitives requires patience** . Releasing the first couple primitive services can sometimes feel random to customers (or the public at large) before we\u2019ve unveiled how these building blocks come together.

In the last 10 years, we\u2019ve tried several Health experiments across various teams\u2014but they were not driven by our primitives approach.

We\u2019ve now created several important building blocks to help transform the customer health experience: Acute Care (via Amazon Clinic), Primary Care (via One Medical), and a Pharmacy service to buy whatever medication a patient may need.

Because of our growing success, Amazon customers are now asking us to help them with all kinds of wellness and nutrition opportunities\u2014which can be partially unlocked with some of our existing grocery building blocks, including Whole Foods Market or Amazon Fresh.\n\nAs a builder, it\u2019s hard to wait for these building blocks to be built versus just combining a bunch of components together to solve a specific problem. The latter can be faster, but almost always slows you down in the future. We\u2019ve seen this temptation in our robotics efforts in our fulfillment network. There are dozens of processes we seek to automate to improve safety, productivity, and cost. Some of the biggest opportunities require invention in domains such as storage automation, manipulation, sortation, mobility of large cages across long distances, and automatic identification of items. Many teams would skip right to the complex solution, baking in \u201cjust enough\u201d of these disciplines to make a concerted solution work, but which doesn\u2019t solve much more, can\u2019t easily be evolved as new requirements emerge, and that can\u2019t be reused for other initiatives needing many of the same components. However, when you think in primitives, like our Robotics team does, you prioritize the building blocks, picking important initiatives that can benefit from each of these primitives, but which build the tool chest to compose more freely (and quickly) for future and complex needs. Our Robotics team has built primitives in each of the above domains that will be lynchpins in our next set of automation, which includes multi-floor storage, trailer loading and unloading, large pallet mobility, and more flexible sortation across our outbound processes (including in vehicles). The team is also building a set of foundation AI models to better identify products in complex environments, optimize the movement of our growing robotic fleet, and better manage the bottlenecks in our facilities.",

However, a question people never ask, and might be even more interesting is **what\u2019s the next set of primitives** you\u2019re building that enables breakthrough customer experiences? If you asked me today, I\u2019d lead with Generative AI (\u201cGenAI\u201d). Much of the early public attention has focused on GenAI _applications_, with the remarkable 2022 launch of ChatGPT. But, to our \u201cprimitive\u201d way of thinking, there are three distinct layers in the GenAI stack, each of which is gigantic, and each of which we\u2019re deeply investing. The **bottom** layer is for developers and companies wanting to build foundation models (\u201cFMs\u201d). The primary primitives are the compute required to train models and generate inferences (or predictions), and the software that makes it easier to build these models. Starting with compute, the key is the chip inside it. To date, virtually all the leading FMs have been trained on Nvidia chips, and we continue to offer the broadest collection of Nvidia instances of any provider. That said, supply has been scarce and cost remains an issue as customers scale their models and applications. Customers have asked us to push the envelope on price-performance for AI chips, just as we have with Graviton for generalized CPU chips. As a result, we\u2019ve built custom AI training chips (named Trainium) and inference chips (named Inferentia). In 2023, we announced second versions of our Trainium and Inferentia chips, which are both meaningfully more price-performant than their first versions and other alternatives. This past fall, leading FM-maker, Anthropic, announced it would use Trainium and Inferentia to build, train, and deploy its future FMs. We already have several customers using our AI chips, including Anthropic, Airbnb, Hugging Face, Qualtrics, Ricoh, and Snap.",

We\u2019re also building several apps in AWS, including arguably the most compelling early GenAI use case\u2014a coding companion. We recently launched Amazon Q, an expert on AWS that writes, debugs, tests, and implements code, while also doing transformations (like moving from an old version of Java to a new one), and querying customers\u2019 various data repositories (e.g. Intranets, wikis, Salesforce, Amazon S3, ServiceNow, Slack, Atlassian, etc.) to answer questions, summarize data, carry on coherent conversation, and take action. Q is the most capable work assistant available today and evolving fast.\n\nWhile we\u2019re building a substantial number of GenAI applications ourselves, the vast majority will ultimately be built by other companies. However, what we\u2019re building in AWS is not just a compelling app or foundation model. These AWS services, at all three layers of the stack, comprise a set of primitives that democratize this next seminal phase of AI, and will empower internal and external builders to transform virtually every customer experience that we know (and invent altogether new ones as well).

While simple in its wording, it\u2019s profound because it gets to the heart of our success to date as well as for the future. The answer lies in our discipline around deeply held principles: 1/ hiring builders who are motivated to continually improve and expand what\u2019s possible; 2/ solving real customer challenges, rather than what we think may be interesting technology; 3/ building in primitives so that we can innovate and experiment at the highest rate; 4/ not wasting time trying to fight gravity (spoiler alert: you always lose)\u2014when we discover technology that enables better customer experiences, we embrace it; 5/ accepting and learning from failed experiments\u2014actually becoming more energized to try again, with new knowledge to employ.\n\nToday, we continue to operate in times of unprecedented change that come with unusual opportunities for growth across the areas in which we operate. For instance, while we have a nearly $500B consumer business, about 80% of the worldwide retail market segment still resides in physical stores. Similarly, with a cloud computing business at nearly a $100B revenue run rate, more than 85% of the global IT spend is still\n\non-premises. These businesses will keep shifting online and into the cloud. In Media and Advertising, content will continue to migrate from linear formats to streaming. Globally, hundreds of millions of people who don\u2019t have adequate broadband access will gain that connectivity in the next few years. Last but certainly not least, Generative AI may be the largest technology transformation since the cloud (which itself, is still in the early stages), and perhaps since the Internet. Unlike the mass modernization of onpremises infrastructure to the cloud, where there\u2019s work required to migrate, this GenAI revolution will be built from the start on top of the cloud. The amount of societal and business benefit from the solutions that will be possible will astound us all.",

The competitive landscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace. Many large players have moved online with credible offerings and have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness, traffic, and sales. Our goal is to move quickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunities in other areas.

We realized that the Web was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simply could not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection than was possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy-to-search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a dogged focus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offer customers gift certificates, 1-Click [SM] shopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and recommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouth remains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customers have placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leader in online bookselling.\n\nBy many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997:\n\n- Sales grew from $15.7 million in 1996 to $147.8 million \u2013 an 838% increase.\n\n- Cumulative customer accounts grew from 180,000 to 1,510,000 \u2013 a 738% increase.\n\n- The percentage of orders from repeat customers grew from over 46% in the fourth quarter of 1996 to over 58% in the same period in 1997.\n\n- In terms of audience reach, per Media Metrix, our Web site went from a rank of 90th to within the top 20.\n\n- We established long-term relationships with many important strategic partners, including America Online, Yahoo!, Excite, Netscape, GeoCities, AltaVista, @Home, and Prodigy.\n\n_Infrastructure_",

To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but in prioritizing our investments.\n\nWe now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have so much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. The challenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several: aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks of product and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding market opportunity.

The worldwide marketplace in which we compete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world. Our current and potential competitors include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we offer and sell to consumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and all distribution channels; (3) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, or acquiring goods and services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services, including website development and hosting, omnichannel sales, inventory and supply chain management, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing; (5) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or offline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or products, including on-premises or cloud-based infrastructure and other services; (7) companies that design, manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, telecommunication, and electronic devices; (8) companies that sell grocery products online and in physical stores; and (9) companies that provide advertising services, whether in digital or other formats. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail businesses include selection, price, and convenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers\u2019 ability and willingness to change business practices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brand recognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive terms, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser-known businesses to compete against us. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.",

The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results), cash flows, liquidity, and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations.

Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer geographic regions. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.",

In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, digital content, and electronic devices continue to increase our competition. The internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser known businesses to compete against us. As a result of competition, our product and service offerings may not be successful, we may fail to gain or may lose business, and we may be required to increase our spending or lower prices, any of which could materially reduce our sales and profits.\n\n_**Our Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks**_\n\nWe may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings. These offerings, which can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience, or are otherwise impacted by, service disruptions, delays, setbacks, or failures or quality issues. In addition, profitability or other intended benefits, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them, which investments are often significant. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the value of those investments being written down or written off. In addition, our sustainability initiatives may be unsuccessful for a variety of reasons, including if we are unable to realize the expected benefits of new technologies or if we do not successfully plan or execute new strategies, which could harm our business or damage our reputation.\n\n_**Our International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks**_\n\nOur international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In certain international market segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations and stores, and promote our brand internationally.

For example, in order to meet local ownership, regulatory licensing, and cybersecurity requirements, we provide\ncertain technology services in China through contractual relationships with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide\nservices. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online\nmulti-brand retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to thirdparty sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold an indirect minority interest in an entity that is a\nthird-party seller on the www.amazon.in marketplace.

For example, we expect a disproportionate amount of our retail sales to occur during our fourth quarter. Our failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. When we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could materially reduce profitability. We regularly experience increases in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. In addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service cosourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand.

Typically, there is also a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of December 31 due to inventory purchases and third-party seller sales. Our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year as vendors and sellers are paid, resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances.\n\n_**We Are Impacted by Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Sellers**_\n\nThe law relating to the liability of online service providers is currently unsettled. In addition, governmental agencies have in the past and could in the future require changes in the way this business is conducted. Under our seller programs, we maintain policies and processes designed to prevent sellers from collecting payments, fraudulently or otherwise, when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers\u2019 descriptions, and to prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen goods, selling goods in an unlawful or unethical manner, violating the proprietary rights of others, or otherwise violating our policies.

Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numerous product categories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, advertising, publishing, and digital content subscriptions.\n\n_Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows._ Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives, including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer experience. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, producing original content, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust.

Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our online stores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment network. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture.\n\n_We seek to turn inventory quickly and collect from consumers before our payments to vendors and sellers become due._ Because consumers primarily use credit cards in our stores, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, supply chain disruptions and resulting vendor lead times, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment and other terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers.",

Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting estimates addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \u2014 Note 1 \u2014 Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.\u201d Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.\n\n_Inventories_\n\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2023, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $355 million.",

We made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $8.3 billion and $5.8 billion in 2022 and 2023. We funded the acquisitions of MGM Holdings Inc. in 2022 and 1Life Healthcare, Inc. (One Medical) in 2023 with cash on hand. In 2023, we invested $1.25 billion in a note from Anthropic, PBC, which is convertible into equity. We have an agreement that expires in Q1 2024 to invest up to an additional $2.75 billion in a second convertible note.\n\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities was $9.7 billion and $(15.9) billion in 2022 and 2023. Cash inflows from financing activities resulted from proceeds from short-term debt, and other and long-term-debt of $62.7 billion and $18.1 billion in 2022 and 2023. Cash outflows from financing activities resulted from repurchases of common stock in 2022, payments of short-term debt, and other, long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations of $53.0 billion and $34.0 billion in 2022 and 2023. Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $675 million and $642 million in 2022 and 2023.",

Our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our long-term debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest.\n\nWe generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term marketable debt securities. Marketable debt securities with fixed interest rates may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.

The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances\nassociated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon\nconsolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and\nwe may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances.

In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, content creators, advertisers, and employees. We serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We offer programs that enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders using our services, and programs that allow authors, independent publishers, musicians, filmmakers, Twitch streamers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell content. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices. In addition, we provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising.\n\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. See \u201cNote 10 \u2014 Segment Information.\u201d\n\n_**Common Stock Split**_\n\nOn May 27, 2022, we effected a 20-for-1 stock split of our common stock and proportionately increased the number of authorized shares of common stock. All share, restricted stock unit (\u201cRSU\u201d), and per share or per RSU information throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. The shares of common stock retain a par value of $0.01 per share. Accordingly, an amount equal to the par value of the increased shares resulting from the stock split was reclassified from \u201cAdditional paid-in capital\u201d to \u201cCommon stock.\u201d\n\n_**Prior Period Reclassifications**_\n\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. \u201cOther assets\u201d were reclassified out of \u201cAccounts receivable, net and other\u201d on our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n_**Principles of Consolidation**_",

Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated.\n\n_**Use of Estimates**_\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, impairment of property and equipment and operating leases, valuation and impairment of investments, self-insurance liabilities, and viewing patterns of capitalized video content. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. For example, in Q4 2023 we completed a useful life study for our servers and are increasing the useful life from five years to six years in January 2024, which, based on servers that are included in \u201cProperty and equipment, net\u201d as of December 31, 2023, will have an anticipated impact to our 2024 operating income of $3.1 billion. We had previously increased the useful life of our servers from four years to five years in January 2022.",

Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.\n\n_Third-party seller services_    - We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders using our services. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. The commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services are rendered, which generally occurs upon delivery of the related products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.\n\n43\n\n_Advertising services_    - We provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising. Revenue is recognized as ads are delivered based on the number of clicks or impressions.\n\n_Subscription services_    - Our subscription sales include fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to content including digital video, audiobooks, digital music, e-books, and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime memberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that represent a single stand-ready obligation. Subscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized over the subscription period.\n\n_AWS_   - Our AWS arrangements include global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is allocated to services using stand-alone selling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services, based on the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. Certain services, including compute and database, are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognized ratably. Sales commissions we pay in connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term.\n\n_Other_   - Other revenue includes sales related to various other offerings, such as certain licensing and distribution of video content, health care services, and shipping services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Revenue is recognized when content is licensed or distributed and as or when services are performed.\n\n_**Return Allowances**_",

The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. Under this method, approximately 50% of the grant date fair value is recognized as expense in the first year of grant for the majority of our stock-based compensation awards. The accelerated method also adds a higher level of sensitivity and complexity in estimating forfeitures. If an award is forfeited early in its life, the adjustment to compensation expense is much greater under an accelerated method than under a straight-line method. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including historical forfeiture experience by grant year and employee level. Additionally, stock-based compensation includes stock appreciation rights that are expected to settle in cash.

Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable.\n\nFor long-lived assets used in operations, including lease assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset\u2019s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. Long-lived assets are considered held for sale when certain criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the asset is available for sale in its immediate condition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date.

We estimate selfinsurance liabilities by considering historical claims experience, frequency and costs of claims, projected claims development, inflation, and other actuarial assumptions. Changes in the number or costs of claims, healthcare costs, judgment and settlement amounts, associated legal expenses, and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we increased our reserves for general, product, and automobile liabilities by $1.3 billion primarily driven by changes in our estimates about the costs of asserted and unasserted claims, which was primarily recorded in \u201cCost of sales\u201d on our consolidated statements of operations and impacted our North America segment.

We also assumed $2.5 billion of debt, which we repaid immediately after closing.

Acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred and were not significant.\n\nIn addition, in August 2022, we entered into an agreement to acquire iRobot Corporation, as amended in July 2023, for approximately $1.7 billion, including its debt, subject to customary closing conditions. In January 2024, we and iRobot agreed to terminate the transaction.\n\n_**Goodwill**_\n\nThe goodwill of the acquired companies is primarily related to expected improvements in technology performance and functionality, as well as sales growth from future product and service offerings and new customers, together with certain intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition.

Wash.\u201d), private litigants have filed a number of cases in the U.S. and Canada alleging, among other things, price fixing arrangements between Amazon.com, Inc. and vendors and third-party sellers in Amazon\u2019s stores, monopolization and attempted monopolization, and consumer protection and unjust enrichment claims. Attorneys General for the District of Columbia and California brought similar suits in May 2021 and September 2022 in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia and the California Superior Court for the County of San Francisco, respectively. Some of the private cases include allegations of several distinct purported classes, including consumers who purchased a product through Amazon\u2019s stores and consumers who purchased a product offered by Amazon through another e-commerce retailer. The complaints seek billions of dollars of alleged damages, treble damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, civil penalties, attorneys\u2019 fees, and costs. The Federal Trade Commission and a number of state Attorneys General filed a similar lawsuit in September 2023 in the W.D. Wash. alleging violations of federal antitrust and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. That complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon has a monopoly in markets for online superstores and marketplace services, and unlawfully maintains those monopolies through anticompetitive practices relating to our pricing policies, advertising practices, the structure of Prime, and promotion of our own products on our website. The complaint seeks injunctive and structural relief, an unspecified amount of damages, and costs. Amazon\u2019s motions to dismiss were granted in part and denied in part in Frame-Wilson in March 2022 and March 2023, De Coster v. Amazon.com, Inc. (W.D. Wash.) in January 2023, and the California Attorney General\u2019s lawsuit in March 2023. All three courts dismissed claims alleging that Amazon\u2019s pricing policies are inherently illegal and denied dismissal of claims alleging that Amazon\u2019s pricing policies are an unlawful restraint of trade. In March 2022, the DC Superior Court dismissed the DC Attorney General\u2019s lawsuit in its entirety; the dismissal is under appeal.

        "text": "In October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on that decision, the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately \u20ac250 million, plus interest, for the period May 2006 through June 2014, and ordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission\u2019s decision, which we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission\u2019s decision. In May 2018, we appealed. On May 12, 2021, the European Union General Court annulled the European Commission\u2019s state aid decision. In July 2021, the European Commission appealed the decision to the European Court of Justice. In December 2023, the European Court of Justice affirmed the European Union General Court\u2019s decision.\n\nChanges in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact our tax contingencies. Due to various factors, including the inherent complexities and uncertainties of the judicial, administrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the timing of the resolution of income tax controversies is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax controversies in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years\u2019 tax filings. The actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements.

Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.\n\n71\n\n**Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm**\n\nThe Board of Directors and Shareholders\nAmazon.com, Inc.\n\n**Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting**\n\nWe have audited Amazon.com, Inc.\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 and the related notes and our report dated February 1, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n**Basis for Opinion**",

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n**Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting**\n\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.",
